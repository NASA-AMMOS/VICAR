## VICAR Discussion Forum

We have set up a [VICAR Open Source Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vicar-open-source/), where you can find notifications of new releases, bug reports, and general discussion. You can join the group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vicar-open-source/join). 

## Obtaining VICAR

The VICAR source code can be obtained via github.com using the links below. In addition to the VICAR source code an externals package containing 3rd party software is required. 

Note that for externals you'll find a tarball that contains all the platforms, as
well as separate ones for each platform. Externals are 3rd party packages that are required to run VICAR. See section 2 of the [Building VICAR document](vos/docsource/vicar/VICAR_build_4.0.pdf) for more information. You need only the one that
applies to your machine type.

Pre-built VICAR binaries are available at https://github.com/nasa/VICAR/releases.
