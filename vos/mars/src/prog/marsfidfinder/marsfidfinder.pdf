.TITLE
VICAR program MARSFIDFINDER.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To determine line/sample offset of a point projected  (inexactly)
to an image.
The resulting tiepoints are output in OUT_TPT for use by
other programs such as MARSNAV.

This is a multimission program.

MARSFIDFINDER supports any mission, instrument, and camera model supported by the
Planetary Image Geometry (Pig) software suite.

EXECUTION:
There are two ways to present input images:

marsfidfinder inp=(a.img,b.img,c.img,...) out_tpt=tiepoints.tpt
or
marsfidfinder inp=ascii_listoffiles out_tpt=tiepoints.tpt

where ascii_listoffiles is a text file created by  an editor,
containing the list of filenames to be searched for fiducials.
Up to 200 input images can be listed.



Then use MARSNAV to generate navigation solutions, and then one of the
mosaic programs:

marsnav inp=files.lis out=mosaic.nav in_tpt=tiepoints.tpt
marsmos inp=files.lis out=mosaic.img navtable=mosaic.nav


USAGE:
The program requires a set of templates for the fiducials. For each
fiducial, there needs to be a template matching all possible filters and eyes
of the target image.Information about the templates is located in one of
2 files, one for engineering and the other for flight.

METHOD:
For each input image
1) determine the image filter number and eye.
2) For each template with same filter and eye
2A) perform correlations by moving the template throughout the search area. Pixels
that are equal to a user specified mask value are ignored when computing the
correlation. The maximum (subpixel) correlation is found by interpolating
all computed correlations about the maximum.

WARNING: The parameters NORMAL, GROUND, SURF_COORD and SURFACE should be the same as
those used in MARSNAV and the mosaic program to get proper results (although
this is less critical with MARSFIDFINDER than with the other programs, because
once you have a tiepoint, the model doesn't matter - the surface is used
only to determine initial points before correlation).

Most stereo cameras (e.g. MPF IMP, M98 SSI) are *not* designed to have their
nodal surface at the azimuth axis.  This introduces LOTS of parallax if single
images contain objects both near and far that do not lie on the surface model.
Pick your points intelligently so you don't pick a near object in this pair
and a far one in that pair, and keep them as close as you can to the surface.

some COORD/mission combos.
Ignored by marsfidfinder.

.VARI FIXED_SITE
Which site is FIXED for

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
There are two options for describing input images. 

Either:
List the image file names 

Or:
provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

.VARI OUT_TPT
Output tiepoint table.
This is an ASCII table with a header, a record indicating the number of
tiepoints, then a series of records, one per tiepoint.  Values in the record
are:
laft_image, right_image, left_sample, left_line, right_sample, right_line,
corrected_sample, corrected_line, quality, interactive_flag


.VARI BAND
The vicar image band number. Defaults to 1

.VARI BORDER
When a fiducial xyz is projected to an image line/sample, if this line/sample is 
not in the image and is not within this distance to the image border, 
the fiducial is ignored.

 


.VARI SEARCHNS
The number of samples to search to the left and right about the point fouund
by projecting the templates centroid (xyz) to the image being searched.
Defaults to 150.
.VARI SEARCHNL
Search lines. See SEARCHNS.


.VARI QUALITY
Minimum acceptable correlation quality. 
Qualities range from 0 (poor) to 1 (excellent).
The computed quality is the value of the highest correlation found when 
searching the search area with the template image.
Defaults to 0.6  



.VARI SEARCHPCNT
The minimum percentage of the template that must be used when performing
correlations. Only parts of the image which lie within the search image are
used to compute correlations. This parameter is used to avoid using too small
of a template which would lead to false positive matches.

Also, only pixels in the template which are not equal to the mask value
are used to compute correlations. See MASK_VALUE.

.VARI START_KEY
Starting key number for the tiepoint file .  Tiepoint files
contain a list of images, each of which is associated with an integer key.
Setting START_KEY to some value allows tiepoint files to be merged easily,
without the keys conflicting.  It is acceptable to have the same image in
different sections of a merged file (with different keys); they are properly
merged when read in.

.VARI MASK_VALUE
When computing correlations, pixels which equal this value are ignored. 

.VARI SEP_ANGLE
Maximum separation angle for image pairs.  If the camera orientations are
separated by more than this angle, the pair is skipped.  This provides a
quick efficiency boost by rejecting spurious pairs.



.VARI NAVTABLE
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using NAVTABLE it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

.VARI VERBOSITY
Controls the amount of messages to display. Choose either INFO (default)
or DEBUG.

.VARI FORMAT
There are two tiepoint file formats: "old" is the simple text-based list,
as used for most of MER, while "new" is an XML-based format that supports
additional tiepoint types.  The FORMAT parameter controls which one to use.
Over time the use of "old" should be phased out and eventually the FORMAT
parameter will disappear.

.VARI NORMAL
The local mars surface normal vector coordinate system specified by SURF_COORD 
parameter (defaults to surface fixed).
For most pan/tilt cameras, if the lander is not tilted this vector
would be: normal=(0,0,-1).  ie: x_component=0, y_component=0, z_component=-1.
This need not be a unit vector.  This vector is used to define the
surface plane to which image points are projected in order to minimize
parallax.
For SPHERE1/2 surface models, normal's first parameter is used to
denote sphere's radius.  Thus to describe sphere of radius R, user
would specify normal=(R, 0, 0).

.VARI GROUND
Any point on the surface, in coordinate system specified by SURF_COORD parameter
(defaults to surface fixed).  This defines where the tilted plane is in space.  
Although any point may be used, normally the point just "under" the origin is selected.
Defaults:
Mars Pathfinder:  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       (lander zero point is on the ground)
Mars 98 Lander:   (0.0, 0.0, 1.64)      (lander zero point is on top of deck)
MER           :   (0.0, 0.0, 0.294)
For MER images taken on top of the lander, the ground is roughly at (0.0, 0.0, 0.7)
For SPHERE1/2 surface models, GROUND parameter is used to denote sphere's
center.  
    
.VARI SURF_COORD
The coordinate system that surface parameters like GROUND and NORMAL are defined in.
For valid values refer to COORD parameter description.  The interpretation of the 
values is dependent on the mission. Defaults to surface fixed coordinate system.
Note that no validation is done for input strings because COORD is using the same
values.  So user needs to be extra careful in specifying SURF_COORD value.  For 
example COORD=local would be correctly interpreted to mean LOCAL_LEVEL because of
validation process.  On the other hand specifying SURF_COORD=local would lead
to underlying code treating the input value as invalid and reverting to default
which is FIXED frame.  So the values for SURF_COORD should be spelled exactly as
found in the list of valid values for COORD parameter.

.VARI SURFACE
The type of mars surface to use. The surface is used to intercept view rays
emanating from the cameras in order to model out parallax between the
stereo cameras. The options are surface=INFINITY which means no surface
is used, surface=PLANE (the default case). If surface = PLANE then the plane
is defined by the NORMAL and GROUND parameters.  For the cases when PLANE 
doesn't match local topography sufficiently well, here are two sphere surface
models: surface=SPHERE1 and surface=SPHERE2.  SPHERE1 is useful to model
convex surfaces like hills, it returns closest(first) ray-surface intersection 
point.  SPHERE2 is useful to model concave surfaces, like crater when the
camera point is outside looking in, it returns farthest(second) ray-surface 
intersection point.  For the case when camera is inside the sphere surface, 
like rover sitting in the crater, there is only a single intersection point
and SPHERE1 and SPHERE2 behave exactly the same. Last, MESH is a surface
model defined by a mesh file (.obj) which path is given with SURF_MESH.

.VARI SURF_MESH 
Mesh OBJ file to use as the surface model. For the mesh to be used,
SURFACE must be set to MESH. The coordinates of the mesh vertices can be 
expressed in any CS. However the mesh CS must be supplied via SURF_CSFILE.
If SURF_CSFILE is not used, then the mesh is assumed to be to the CS that
results from COORD or SURF_COORD

VARI SURF_CSFILE 
File name of a vicar file whose CS (contained in the labels) will be read and
assigned to the SURFACE model. The type of image and its content are of no
interest, we are just reading the CS. That CS will supersede any other surface 
CS definition (COORD or SURF_COORD). Its typical use is to supply a CS to a
given mesh file (expectedly the XYZ from which the mesh is computed from, but
doesn't have to). But SURF_CSFILE could be use to define a CS in which NORMAL 
and GROUND for a PLANE surface are expressed in.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI NOSITE
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

.VARI RSF
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if <dir> is the name specified in the
RSF parameter, the following files will be searched for:

<dir>/master/<mission>_Master.svf
<dir>/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
This parameter is ignored by marsfidfinder.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI COORD_INDEX
This parameter is ignored by marsfidfinder.  It is here for compatibility
with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI FIXED_SITE
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The FIXED_SITE parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, FIXED_SITE defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must FIXED_SITE be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the RSF parameter.
