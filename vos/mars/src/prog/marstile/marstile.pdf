.TITLE
VICAR program MARSTILE.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To assemble Mars 2020 (M2020) Rover Enhanced Engineering Camera (EECAM) tiles
into assembled EDR images.

EXECUTION:

marstile inp=tile_list.lis out=assembled_edr.vic
where:
tile_list.lis is a list of image tiles corresponding to a single integration,
that can be in color or black-and-white.
assembled_edr.vic is an assembled EDR composed of the individual tiles.

Additionally, single-resolution outputs may be specified using the OUT_1X,
OUT_2X, OUT_4X, and OUT_8X parameters. These outputs will only contain tiles
with the corresponding downsampling factor and will be reproduced at their
original resolution.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
input image(s) or
file list.

.VARI OUT
Output image file.

.VARI OUT_1X
Output image with 1x
resolution tiles only.

.VARI OUT_2X
Output image with 2x
resolution tiles only.

.VARI OUT_4X
Output image with 4x
resolution tiles only.

.VARI OUT_8X
Output image with 8x
resolution tiles only.

.VARI BAND
The BSQ band number.

.VARI ZOOM
The upsampling zoom of the
unified output product.

.VARI BORDER
The number of border pixels.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
Path used to find
configuration/calibration
files.

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-
specific pointing
method to use

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
Specifies the full name given
to a data set or a data product.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
Specifies a unique alphanumeric
identifier for a data set or data
product.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
Specifies the unique identifier
associated with the release to the
public of all or part of a data set.
The release number is associated with
the data set, not the mission.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique
identifier assigned to a data
product by its producer.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier
of an entity associated with the
production a data set.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the full name of the
identity of an entity associated
with the production of a data set.

.VARI COORD
Should always be ROVER.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
There are two options for describing input images.

1) List the image file names
2) Provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

If only one value is given, it is assumed that the value is the name of a
file list file. However, if the file appears to be a VICAR image, then it
is treated as an actual image name. This means that you can simply assemble
a single tile:

marstile inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

.VARI OUT
Output image containing the assembled tiles.

By default, the output will have the same number of bands
as the input with the most bands, and all bands will be processed. Inputs
with fewer than that many bands repeat their last band, so black-and-white
and color images can be mixed.

.VARI OUT_1X
Output image containing 1x (full-resolution) assembled tiles.

By default, the output will have the same number of bands
as the input with the most bands, and all bands will be processed. Inputs
with fewer than that many bands repeat their last band, so black-and-white
and color images can be mixed.

.VARI OUT_2X
Output image containing 2x (half-resolution) assembled tiles.
The output will also be at half-resolution.

.VARI OUT_4X
Output image containing 4x (quarter-resolution) assembled tiles.
The output will be at quarter-resolution.

.VARI OUT_8X
Output image containing 8x (eighth-resolution) assembled tiles.
The output will be at eighth-resolution.

.VARI BAND
The BSQ input file band number. Defaults to all bands in image, but will use
a value of 1 if an invalid band is specified. Providing a value will cause
only that band to be processed.

.VARI ZOOM
The upsampling zoom factor of the image. This zoom factor only applies to
the unified output image.

.VARI BORDER
The number of border pixels associated with each tile. The default value
used on the Mars 2020 mission is 8 pixels, but if the value is set to 0,
the border will be filled in with neighboring tile data, if available.
The border is used for interpolation, but removed for final image
assembly. Border data will be used in the output if a gap would be created
by its removal.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
The DATA_SET_NAME typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_NAME.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
The DATA_SET_ID value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
DATA_SET_ID is an abbreviation of the DATA_SET_NAME.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_ID.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the RELEASE_ID is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword RELEASE_ID.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword PRODUCT_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword PRODUCER_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

.VARI COORD
Sets the CS used for the rover derived geometry params.  Should always
be ROVER or you'll get unexpected results.
