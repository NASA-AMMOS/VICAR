TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

    TP2DISP INP=(imgfiles) TP=(inptie)
     
    where

    imgfiles is one or more VICAR images suitable for creating a PigFileModel.
    inptie   is an input XML tiepoint files used to generate disparity mappings.

OPERATION

    TP2DISP generates a set of disparity map images from an input
    tiepoint file. Each tiepoint is used to set a line/samp pixel
    value in the disparity maps of the two tied images. Every image
    referenced in the tiepoint file must be provided in the set of
    input images. Only the input image labels are used, so either EDR 
    or RDR files can be used.

    Output disparity map image naming is based on the unique IDs of
    each input image file. A given tiepoint having a left and right
    image will be stored in two new files named
    LEFTID_RIGHTID_DISP.VIC and RIGHTID_LEFTID_DISP.VIC where the
    shapes of the first and second DSP images are derived respectively
    from the LEFTID and RIGHTID input files. The output images are
    written to the current directory.

.LEVEL1

.VAR INP
Image files referenced by TP tiepoint file.

.VAR TP
Tiepoint file.

.LEVEL2

.VAR INP
A required EDR or RDR type file corresponding to the image referenced
in the tiepoint file. Only the RHS labels are used, so either EDR 
or RDR files can be used.

.VAR TP
An input XML text file representing a set of tiepoints. Each tiepoint
is used to set a line/samp pixel value in the disparity maps of the
two tied images.
