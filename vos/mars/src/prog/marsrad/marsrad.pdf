.TITLE
VICAR program MARSRAD.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To radiometrically correct an image, usually an EDR.

This is a multimission program.  It supports any mission, instrument,
and camera model supported by the Planetary Image Geometry (Pig) software
suite and its associated Radiometry models (mars_radiometry).

The output file will have the same labels as the input, with the addition
of the radiometric correction scale factors (RADIANCE_SCALING_FACTOR and
RADIANCE_OFFSET).

Multiple images can be given to the program, in which case each is corrected
independently.  The number of outputs must match the number of inputs.

The program will work with color images if such are given as input and
the BAND parameter is not specified; the number of output bands will equal
the number of input bands.  If BANDS is specified, only that one single band
is processed and output.

NOTE: currently the SAME rad correction is applied to ALL bands.  This
should probably be fixed.

EXECUTION:

The inputs and outputs may be presented in two ways:
1) Normal file parameters, e.g. inp=(a.img,b.img,c.img...)
2) A file list, e.g. inp=filelist.txt

The file list is a simple ASCII text file containing one filename per line.

If only one value is given for the INP or OUT parameter, it is assumed that
the value is the name of a file list file.  However, if the file appears to
be a VICAR image, or if it doesn't exist (OUT only), then it is treated as
an actual image name.  This means that you can simply correct a single image:

marsrad inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

The number of input filename must match the number of output filenames, but
it is okay if one is a file list and the other is directly entered in the
parameter.

The default is to create a short int (HALF) format file, with radiometric
values scaled to short int using DNSCALE.  However, specifying FORMAT=REAL
will create a floating point file, in actual physical units.  Note that
DNSCALE=1.0 should be used in this case.

If BITS is specified (and FORMAT=REAL is not), then the results are clamped
to have that many bits, e.g. if BITS is 12 then the results will be in the
range 0-4095.  The sample bit mask in the label will be set appropriately.
As a backward compatibility feature, if BITS is not set then there is no
clamping but the sample bit mask is still set to 15 bits.  BITS is ignored
for floating-point files.

OPERATION:

The specific algorithm used for radiometric correction depends on the mission
type, but most are similar.

MARS PATHFINDER / MARS 98
-------------------------

The absolute radiance S of a single pixel (at a location (i,j) in an image)
is given by

S(i,j) = DN(i,j)/(t * R(lambda,temperature) * G(i,j))

where
DN(i,j) is the instrument signal (in units of DN) from the input image
G(i,j) is the normalized flat field of the camera system (which corrects
    for the pixel to pixel sensitivity variations)
t is the exposure time of the image (in seconds)
R(lambda,temperature) is the responsivity curve defined by a quadratic
    function in temperature.
temperature is the camera head temperature in degrees C.
lambda is the wavelength in nm, which is derived from the filter.

t, temperature, and filter are derived from the image label.  G depends
on the filter and eye (left or right), which are also derived from the
image label.

Flat field files are obtained via the CONFIG_PATH parameter.

The responsivity function R is embedded in the source code; refer to
mars_radiometry.com if details are required.

The dark current of the camera (i.e., the signal that does not correspond
to photons incident onto the detector) is insignificant at the low Martian
temperatures experienced by the lander cameras and is not subtracted for
the calculations presented here.  (During Mars Pathfinder surface operations,
the largest dark current of the camera (2 PM local solar time, camera
temperature = -9 degrees C) was < 2 counts/sec (less than 0.5 % in radiance
for well-exposed pixels)).

For more information, see Maki et al., 1999 (JGR).

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
There are two options for describing input images.
 
1) List the image file names
2) Provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

If only one value is given, it is assumed that the value is the name of a
file list file.  However, if the file appears to be a VICAR image, then it
is treated as an actual image name.  This means that you can simply correct
a single image:

marsrad inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

.VARI OUT
There are two options for describing output images.

1) List the image file names
2) Provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

If only one value is given, it is assumed that the value is the name of a
file list file.  However, if the file appears to be a VICAR image, or if
it doesn't exist, then it is treated as an actual image name.  This means
that you can simply correct a single image:

marsrad inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

.VARI BAND
Specifies which band from the input image to write to the output image file.
If no band is specified, all bands from the input image will be processed then
written to the output image.

.VARI TAU
Tau is a measure of atmospheric opacity.  The default for normal Mars conditions 
is 0.6. Higher tau means more dust in the atmosphere.

.VARI RAD
Keyword paramter that selects radiometric correction mode of the input images.
RAD (the default) enables the correction (for missions/instruments which support 
it); NORAD disables it; ZENITH_SCALED_RAD the radiometry you'd get if the sun 
were at zenith on a clear day.  The scaling factor is a combination of solar 
elevation and tau, and will have the effect of brightening up images that 
were taken near sunset.
  
NORAD is not of much use in MARSRAD, since turning off radiometric correction 
would defeat the entire purpose of MARSRAD! 

.VARI DNSCALE
DN scaling factor.  This factor is used to convert between physical
radiometric units (watts/(meter**2, steradian, micron)) and DN's for the
output mosaic.  The formula is:

true_radiance = offset + (factor * DN)

where "offset" is 0.0 in the current implementation, and "factor" is
1.0 / DNSCALE (making the formula equivalently:  offset + (DN / DNSCALE)).
The offset and factor (1.0/DNSCALE) are written to the output mosaic label.

If FORMAT=REAL is specified, DNSCALE should be set to 1.0, or a warning
will be printed.  The given DNSCALE is still applied, however.

.VARI DNSCALE_IN
Three-state keyword parameter to control whether or not to apply scaling
parameters to reconstruct floating point values.

RESCALE says to do the conversion, and reconstitute the float based on the 
RADIANCE_* keywords.  Note that if there are no RADIANCE_* keywords, 
this is a no-op, so it doesn't hurt to turn this on for non-scaled images.

NOSCALE says to not to the conversion.  This is what we do now.  If your 
inputs are dynamically scaled, you'll probably get surprising results.

AUTOSCALE says to figure it out based on the DNSCALE_OUT parameter (see 
DNSCALE_OUT for details) and -ZENITH_SCALED_RAD flag. If DNSCALE_OUT is STATIC, 
then it is NOSCALE; if DNSCALE_OUT is DYNAMIC/IDENTIT or RAD=ZENITH_SCALED_RAD,
then it is RESCALE.

.VARI DNSCALE_OUT
Three-state keywork parameter to scale output DN values.

If -STATIC is enabled, then the value specified by DNSCALE will be used
as the DN scaling factor (note the unit scaling factor as well) for all
radiometric models supplied.

If -DYNAMIC is enabled, then the maximum responsivity value across all
radiometric models will be used as the DN scaling factor (note the unit
scaling factor as well).

If -IDENTITY is enabled, then no scaling will be applied.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI FORMAT
Selects short int (HALF) or float (REAL) output format.  The default
is short int; the values are scaled using DNSCALE to the short int range.
However, direct radiometry units can be created using -REAL.  In this case,
DNSCALE should be set to 1.0 (if not, a warning is printed, but DNSCALE
*is* used).

.VARI BITS
If BITS is specified (and FORMAT=REAL is not), then the results are clamped
to have that many bits, e.g. if BITS is 12 then the results will be in the
range 0-4095.  The sample bit mask in the label will be set appropriately.
As a backward compatibility feature, if BITS is not set then there is no
clamping but the sample bit mask is still set to 15 bits.  BITS is ignored
for floating-point files.

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
The DATA_SET_NAME typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_NAME.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
The DATA_SET_ID value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
DATA_SET_ID is an abbreviation of the DATA_SET_NAME.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_ID.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the RELEASE_ID is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword RELEASE_ID.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword PRODUCT_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword PRODUCER_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satelite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI RSF
The Rover State File is loaded by, but not used by, marsrad.  The parameter
exists for compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see
e.g. marsmap).

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI COORD_INDEX
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI FIXED_SITE
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).
