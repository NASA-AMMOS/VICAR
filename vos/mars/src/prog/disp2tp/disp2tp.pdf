    where

    dspfiles is one or more input double-band, real-valued VICAR images.
    rhsfiles is one or more VICAR images suitable for creating a PigFileModel.
    outtie   is an output XML text file representing a set of tiepoints.
    xyzfiles is one or more optional input XYZ files mapped to the corresponding dspfile.
    inptie   is one or more optional input XML tiepoint files used to select tiepoints.

    PARMS	
        count is the approximate number of tiepoints to be generated.

OPERATION

    DISP2TP generates an XML tiepoint file connecting the left and
    right images from one or more input disparity maps. INP is one or
    more double-band, real-valued VICAR image disparity maps. OUT
    is an xml text file representing the set of tiepoints. The output
    tiepoint file identifies the left and right images using a PIG
    unique ID. The RHS files must be equal in number to INP, and
    correspond in order to the INP files. They are used to determine
    the RHS unique ID for each disparity map. Only the RHS labels are
    used, so either EDR or RDR files can be used.

    If provided, INPTIE is used to select the tiepoints to generate
    from a dspfile. Otherwise, CNT is used to generate a line/sample
    sampling frequency such that approximately CNT tiepoints are
    generated. The tiepoints are selected with approximately uniform
    2-d spacing. The linear sampling frequency is approximately
    sqrt(NL*NS/CNT). However, selected tiepoints are discarded when
    the disparity value is undefined. Tiepoints also are discarded
    when an optional XYZ file is provided and the XYZ is undefined.
    For example, the test cases ask for 100 points but get only 28
    without an XYZ file, and 21 with an XYZ file. A future
    enhancement could count the undefined disparity values (and
    optionally the undefined XYZ values) and scale the requested
    number of tiepoints to yield a tiepoint set size closer to that
    requested.
   
    If there are less INPTIE files than INP files, then the n INPTIE
    files will be associated in order with the first n INP files. XYZ
    files are associated similarly with INP files.

    Following is a minimal example of an XML tiepoint file:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tiepoint_file version="1.0">
    <tiepoint_set>
      <reference_frame name="FIXED" index1="22" />
      <images>
        <image unique_id="MLG_436644282DSR_S0220000MCAM01813M1" key="0" />
        <image unique_id="MRG_436644282DSR_S0220000MCAM01813M1" key="1" />
      </images>
      <tiepoints>
        <tie type="0" left_key="0" right_key="1">
          <left      line="71" samp="491" />
          <projected line="145.984558" samp="138.428513" />
          <right     line="145.984558" samp="138.428513" />
          <flags quality="1.0" interactive="0" />
        </tie>
      </tiepoints>
    </tiepoint_set>

.LEVEL1

.VAR INP
One or more disparity
images.

.VAR OUT
An XML tiepoint file.

.VAR RHS
Required EDR or RDR
type image file(s).

.VAR XYZ
Optional xyz file(s).

.VAR INPTIE
Optional XML input
tiepoint file(s).

.VAR CNT
The number of
tiepoints to generate.

.VAR TRAD_MODE
Selects output
tiepoint type.

.LEVEL2

.VAR INP
A required double-band, real-valued VICAR image of disparity values.

.VAR OUT
An XML text file representing a set of tiepoints.

.VAR RHS
A required EDR or RDR type file corresponding to the disparity image.
Each input disparity image must have a RHS to determine the unique ID
for each disparity map. Only the RHS labels are used, so either EDR 
or RDR files can be used.

.VAR XYZ
An optional xyz file used to discard tp that do not have valid xyz
data. If there are less xyz files than disparity files, then the n xyz
files will be associated in order with the first n disparity files.

.VAR INPTIE
An optional XML text file representing a set of tiepoints. If
provided, any cnt parameter will be ignored, and the inptie file will
be used to select tiepoints for generation. If there are less inptie
files than disparity files, then the n inptie files will be associated
in order with the first n disparity files.

.VAR CNT
The approximate number of tiepoints to be generated, ignored if inptie
is provided. If INPTIE is not provided, then CNT is used to generate a
line/sample sampling frequency such that approximately CNT tiepoints
are generated. The tiepoints are selected with approximately uniform
2-d spacing. The linear sampling frequency is approximately
sqrt(NL*NS/CNT). However, selected tiepoints are discarded when the
disparity value is undefined. Tiepoints also are discarded when an
optional XYZ file is provided and the XYZ is undefined.  For example,
the test cases ask for 100 points but get only 28 without an XYZ file,
and 21 with an XYZ file.

.VAR TRAD_MODE
Used to select output tiepoint type. Valid choices are TRADITIONAL and
MISS_DISTANCE.  The tiepoint data are the same, but this type
distinction directs marsnav to calculate error in different ways.
With TRADITIONAL, the error is based on line/sample differences in the
image space.  With MISS_DISTANCE, the error is based on the distance
in xyz space between the rays to the left and right tiepoints, as
calculated by xvector.
