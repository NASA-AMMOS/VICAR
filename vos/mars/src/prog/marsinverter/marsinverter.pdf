.TITLE
VICAR program MARSINVERTER.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To reverse the 12->8 bit compression in an image file by shifting or processing
it through an Inverse Look-Up Table (ILUT).

This is a multimission program.  It supports any mission, instrument,
and camera model supported by the Planetary Image Geometry (Pig) software
suite and its associated Radiometry models (mars_radiometry).

Images are often compressed in dynamic range via a 12->8 bit conversion.
This conversion takes one of two forms:  bit shifting, which simply shifts
the bits some specified amount, and a Look-Up Table (LUT), which can implement
nonlinear conversions.  This program recovers the original DN values (or
at least approximations thereof) by reversing this scaling.

EXECUTION:

The inputs and outputs may be presented in two ways:
1) Normal file parameters, e.g. inp=(a.img,b.img,c.img...)
2) A file list, e.g. inp=filelist.txt

The file list is a simple ASCII text file containing one filename per line.

If only one value is given for the INP or OUT parameter, it is assumed that
the value is the name of a file list file.  However, if the file appears to
be a VICAR image, or if it doesn't exist (OUT only), then it is treated as
an actual image name.  This means that you can simply correct a single image:

marsinverter inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

The number of input filenames must match the number of output filenames, but
it is okay if one is a file list and the other is directly entered in the
parameter.  Up to 20 images can be inverted in a single call.

.PAGE
OPERATION:

The program looks for inverse LUT files in the calibration directories,
as specified by the CONFIG_PATH parameter.  It looks for files of the
form:

	ilut/<host_id>_<lut_name>.txt

where host_id is the name of the mission (e.g. MER1, MER2, MSL) and lut_name
is the name of the lookup table as specified in the label.

The lookup table itself is simply a text file with (nominally) 256 lines.
Each line contains the 8-bit value followed by the expanded value, separated
by spaces.

A few of the LUT names are special cases, with the ILUT generated
programmatically.  The name "NONE" is a no-op (no conversion is done).
The names "MSB_BIT7" through "MSB_BIT15" indicate a bit shift, shifing
0 to 8 bits respectively to create a 12-bit output.

The output is normally expected to be 12 bits, but the program will support
any number of bits up to 16 using the BITS parameter (in reality this just
affects the SAMPLE_BIT_MASK label; the actual size of the outputs is controlled
by the ILUT file itself).  However, if the ORIGINAL_SAMPLE_BITS label exists
(in INSTRUMENT_STATE_PARMS), that value will be used as the default for BITS
(the parameter will still override).

Although normally used for 8->12 bit expansion, in reality the program is
more flexible, accepting anything that will fit in a (signed) integer for
both input and output.  The ILUT file can contain more or less than 256
entries.  However, the bit-shift special modes assume 8->12.

identifier for a data set or data
product.

.VARI RELEASE_ID

associated with the release to the
public of all or part of a data set.
The release number is associated with
the data set, not the mission.

Specifies the unique identifier
of an entity associated with the
production a data set.

Specifies the full name of the
identity of an entity associated
with the production of a data set.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
There are two options for describing input images.
 
1) List the image file names
2) Provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

If only one value is given, it is assumed that the value is the name of a
file list file.  However, if the file appears to be a VICAR image, then it
is treated as an actual image name.  This means that you can simply correct
a single image:

marsrad inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

.VARI OUT
There are two options for describing output images.

1) List the image file names
2) Provide an ascii file with the file names listed, one per record.

If only one value is given, it is assumed that the value is the name of a
file list file.  However, if the file appears to be a VICAR image, or if
it doesn't exist, then it is treated as an actual image name.  This means
that you can simply correct a single image:

marsrad inp=a.img out=a.out

without having to create file lists.

.VARI BAND
Specifies which band from the input image to write to the output image file.
If no band is specified, all bands from the input image will be processed then
written to the output image.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI BITS
The output is normally expected to be 12 bits, but the program will support
any number of bits up to 16 using the BITS parameter (in reality this just
affects the SAMPLE_BIT_MASK label; the actual size of the outputs is controlled
by the ILUT file itself).  However, if the ORIGINAL_SAMPLE_BITS label is
present (in INSTRUMENT_STATE_PARAMS), that is used as the default instead of
12 (the BITS parameter still overrides).

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
The DATA_SET_NAME typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_NAME.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
The DATA_SET_ID value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
DATA_SET_ID is an abbreviation of the DATA_SET_NAME.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_ID.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the RELEASE_ID is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword RELEASE_ID.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword PRODUCT_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword PRODUCER_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satelite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI RSF
The Rover State File is loaded by, but not used by, marsrad.  The parameter
exists for compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see
e.g. marsmap).

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI COORD_INDEX
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI FIXED_SITE
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).
