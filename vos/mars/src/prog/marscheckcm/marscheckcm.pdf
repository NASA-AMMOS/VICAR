VICAR program MARSCHECKCM.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Given input file, compare camera models obtained via various means.
Currently compares camera model found in the input file's label(LABEL)
to camera model obtained by applying kinematics transformation to 
calibration camera models(KINEM).
Here is the typical output:

C_LABEL =     +0.60500199     -0.04757390     -1.19755995
C_KINEM =     +0.60500246     -0.04757336     -1.19755828
|DIFF | =      0.00000048      0.00000054      0.00000167
C_DIFF  =              OK            FAIL            FAIL

The first two lines print out vector components for camera models
that are being compared.  Third line prints out absolute value
of the difference of first two lines.  Fourth lines checks wether
difference exceeds specified tolerance value.  Tolerance value
is percent % of the magnitude of the minimum of the two input values:
IF (|DIFF| < |min(C_LABEL,C_KINEM)|*tolerance) THEN OK ELSE ERROR

NOTE: make sure that POINT_METHOD doesn't contain cm="method" string.
Otherwise the behaviour is undefined.

HISTORY:
Dec. 2003  Initial version
COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  Oleg Pariser

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
input image or
file list.

.VARI TOL
Tolerance.  Specifies the allowable
difference of individual components.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
Path used to find
configuration/calibration
files.

.VARI RSF
Rover State File(s) to use.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
Turns on debugging of RSF
parameter.

.VARI COORD
Coordinate system to use.
Not used by this program.

.VARI COORD_INDEX
Coordinate system index for
some COORD/mission combos.
Not used by this program.

.VARI FIXED_SITE
Which site is FIXED for
rover missions.
Not used by this program.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Input image.

.VARI TOL
Tolerance value
is percent % of the magnitude of the minimum of the two input values:
IF (|DIFF| > |min(C_LABEL,C_KINEM)|*tolerance) THEN FAIL ELSE OK

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI RSF
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if <dir> is the name specified in the
RSF parameter, the following files will be searched for:

<dir>/master/<mission>_Master.svf
<dir>/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI COORD_INDEX
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI FIXED_SITE
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).
