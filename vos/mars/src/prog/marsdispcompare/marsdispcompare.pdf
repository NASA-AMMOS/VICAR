VICAR program  MARSDISPCOMPARE

.HELP
PURPOSE:
This program is meant to be part of processing chain which ends up 
with L->R disparity image, a R->L disparity image, and  a mask 
indicating which values in the l->R disparity image should be ignored.
This is determined by comparing the L->R and R->L results for consistency.
If they don't map to the same result, the pixel is rejected.

EXECUTION:
marsdispcompare inp=(left,right) out=disparity_mask 


where:
left is the L->R disparity image
right is the R->L disparity image
out is the output mask indicating which disparity values in the left 
image to be ignored.

All of these images can be created with marscor3. 
.PAGE

METHOD:

The program loops through every pixel in the disparity image.  
For each pixel (optionally satisfying a quality threshold) in the L->R 
disparity image, 
the  location in the R->L disparity image is found. At this location, 
which is commonly not an integer, A bilinear interpolation is 
performed using the 4 nearest neighbors. 
(Optionally, the interpolation may be limited to the case where all nearest
neighbors satisfy a quality threshold) 
This interpolated value gives a location in L->R image. If this location 
is close to the original pixel, satisfying a user specified threshold, 
the output mask value is set to 0. Otherwise, it is set to 1. 
This creates the mask for the L->R disparity image. The mask for the R->L
disparity image may be obtained by running marsdispcompare again with 
RL and LR switched.

The following set of commands demonstrate how the mask is created
1) ./marsjplstereo inp= \(SS009FFL897017919_11A7EL1M1.IMG,
SS009FFL897017919_11A7ER1M1.IMG \) out=DISPLR.IMG MAXDISP=25   
This creates the low quality L->R disparity image
2)~/marsdispinvert/marsdispinvert INP=DISPLR.IMG OUT=DISPRL.IMG FILL_VALUE=127
This creates a low quality R->L disparity image with default value set to 127. 
The default value can be determined by inspection of the original images. 
Note: This value is a delta value;
3)./marscor3 inp=\(SS009FFL897017919_11A7EL1M1.IMG,SS009FFL897017919_11A7ER1M1.IMG\) 
out=DISP2LR.IMG in_disp=DISPLR.IMG  
This creates the high quality disparity. 
4)./marscor3 inp=\(SS009FFL897017919_11A7ER1M1.IMG,SS009FFL897017919_11A7EL1M1.IMG\) 
out=DISP2RL.IMG in_disp=DISPRL.IMG
The creates the high quality R->L disparity.
5)  ./marsdispcompare INP=\(DISP2LR.IMG,DISP2RL.IMG\) OUT=out.msk
This creates the disparity mask.

COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  Mathew Yeates

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
input images.
first: left to right disparity 
image
second:  right  to left 
disparity image

.VARI O_THRESH
outlier (in pixels)
threshold.

.VARI MINDIST
distance (in pixels) threshold.

.VARI OUT
output disparity mask

.VARI QUALITYRL
input R-> L disparity quality 
image

.VARI QUALITYLR
input L-> R disparity quality 
image

.VARI SCALING
Activate scaling of thresholds

.VARI QUALITY_THRESH
Two thresholds that the values 
in the quality images must 
satisfy.
first  - left disparity image
second - right disparity image


.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
input images.
first: left to right disparity image
second:  right  to left disparity image

.VARI O_THRESH
Used to test for outliers.
All four neighbors used in the bilinear interpolation must
be within this distance (in pixels) of each  other.

.VARI MINDIST
Threshold on the acceptable distance (in pixels) after projecting 
back into the L->R disparity image.

.VARI OUT
output disparity mask wich is a single banded byte file.  The pixels
dn values can be either 0 or 255, no other values are allowed.
Pixels with dn value of 0 are the ones that passed consistency check.
Pixels with dn value of 255 either failed consistency check or had
no correlation value to begin with.


.VARI QUALITYRL
(Optional)
input R-> L disparity quality image

.VARI QUALITYLR
(Optional)
input L-> R disparity quality image


.VARI QUALITY_THRESH
(Optional)
Two thresholds that the values in the quality images must satisfy.
first  - left disparity image
second - right disparity image
(If only one quality image is provided, only 1 threshold is required)

.VARI SCALING
The default threshold parameters (O_THRESH and MINDIST) assumes a scaling ratio
of about 1 between the images. That is L and R have about the same scale. In 
situation where the scale is different, say L is high resolution compared to
R, then these thresholds can be adjusted to account for it. For instance if 
the two images have a scale ratio of 10, the disparity map accuracy will be 
driven by the low resolution image. When comparing the disparity for the high
resolution image, we cannot expect an accuracy of mindist of 2 pixels (default)
which would require a correlation subpixel precision of 2/10 of a pixel.
If SCALING is activated, the average scale factor contained in the label of the
disparities is accounted for and adjust O_THRESH and MINDIST accordingly (
simple multiplication by the average scaling factor)
