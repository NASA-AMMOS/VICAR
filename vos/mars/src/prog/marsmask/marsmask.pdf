.TITLE
VICAR program MARSMASK.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Apply the mask to the image.

This is a multimission program. 
It supports any mission.


EXECUTION:
marsmask inp=inputi_image out=input_masked_image mask=mask_image

.PAGE

METHOD:
Mask consists of zero and non-zero data.  For each pixel in the mask that 
is non-zero, the corresponding pixel in the input image is assigned DN of zero.
Inversion of this process is supported as well via INVERT parameter.
If number of bands in the mask file is not the same as in input file,
only first band of the mask is used and applied to all bands of the input.
The rest of the bands of the mask will be ignored in that case.  

INP: Image to be masked.  All data type formats are supported.

MASK: BYTE-formatted image. If the mask is single banded, same mask will
be applied to all bands of the input image.  If the number of bands of the
mask matches number of bands of the input image, then the mask will be
applied on per-band basis.

OUT:  Masked-out input image.

By default, the output label is derived from the mask image.  That's because
the mask is generally made from the same input file, so using it means the
mask program (marsfilter or marsdispcompare) is included in the history label.
However, if the mask does not have a proper label, or is otherwise
inappropriate, -IMAGE will cause the label to be derived from the input image
instead.

If -CORR is set, the image is a correlation image, so the
CORRELATION_PIXEL_COUNT label will be set with the number of non-zero pixels
in the output.  This is not the same as the number of non-masked pixels in
the mask, as the input might be zero even where the mask lets data through.
In addition, the CORRELATION_AVERAGE_SCALE is transferred from the image
label to the output, even if -IMAGE is not specified.  While the average
scale may not be accurate any more due to masking, it is only an estimate
to start with.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input image.
Must be 1.

.VARI OUT
Output file
Must be 1.

.VARI MASK
The mask to apply. 

.VARI INVERT
Whether to invert the mask

.VARI LABEL
Which label to apply to output

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
Specifies the full name given
to a data set or a data product.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
Specifies a unique alphanumeric
identifier for a data set or data
product.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
Specifies the unique identifier
associated with the release to the
public of all or part of a data set.
The release number is associated with
the data set, not the mission.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique
identifier assigned to a data
product by its producer.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier
of an entity associated with the
production a data set.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the full name of the
identity of an entity associated
with the production of a data set.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target.


.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Input image that the the mask is going to be applied.
Must be 1.

.VARI OUT
Output file containing masked image data.  The output file
is in the same format as input file.
Must be 1.


.VARI MASK
The mask to apply. It is expected to be in BYTE format.  

.VARI INVERT
If INVERT is specified, the mask is inverted from the default (so formerly
masked areas are now passed, and vice-versa).

.VARI LABEL
By default, the output label is derived from the mask image.  That's because
the mask is generally made from the same input file, so using it means the
mask program (marsfilter or marsdispcompare) is included in the history label.
However, if the mask does not have a proper label, or is otherwise
inappropriate, -IMAGE will cause the label to be derived from the input image
instead.

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
The DATA_SET_NAME typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_NAME.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
The DATA_SET_ID value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
DATA_SET_ID is an abbreviation of the DATA_SET_NAME.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_ID.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the RELEASE_ID is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword RELEASE_ID.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword PRODUCT_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword PRODUCER_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satelite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.
