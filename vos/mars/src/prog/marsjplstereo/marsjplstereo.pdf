.TITLE
VICAR program MARSJPLSTEREO.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
This program computes disparity maps from a stereo pair. The images
are assumed to be aligned (CAHV linearized), hence only the sample
disparity map is computed. The line disparity map is output as 0
disparity (i.e. DN matches line number).  In contrast to MARSCORR,
this program relies on camera model to do the computations.  The
camera model is derived from the PIG (Planetary Image Geometry)
library in the standard way.

The resulting line and sample disparity maps can be used as input to
MARSXYZ routine to convert disparity maps to XYZ images.  That output
can further be sent to MARSRANGE to generate range maps.  The disparity
map file format is compatible with the output of MARSCORR; see the help
for that program for file format details.

This program is also in theory capable of performing trinocular stereo
matching with left, right and bottom cameras.  However, THIS HAS NOT
BEEN TESTED.

The underlying correlation library works with 8-bit data only.  Since
most mission data is 16 bits (really 12, in a 16-bit image), a percent
linear stretch is done to convert to byte before sending the image into
the correlator.  This results in some loss of precision but shouldn't
cause too much trouble in practice.  Normally the histograms for all
inputs are combined so a single stretch is performed, but if the cameras
are of unequal brightness, the SEPARATE flag will cause the images to be
stretched independently.  The correlator is rather sensitive to overall
brightness levels.

This routine is based on the JPL Stereo code developed in the JPL
Robotics Division.  Great deal of help and explanation was provided by
Mark Maimone <mwm@helios.jpl.nasa.gov>. 

In this program, input images must be projected from CAHVOR/CAHVORE
space to CAHV space, i.e. run MARSCAHV routine to remove distortion. 
The underlying correlation library supports CAHVOR/CAHVORE models,
but simply does an internal warp to CAHV before correlating.  It was
thus decided that the complexity of supporting CAHVOR/CAHVORE directly
was not worthwhile, since CAHV images are normally created anyway.

If pyramid level is not zero, image dimensions are truncated(if necessary)
to the max. multiple of pyramid level.  For example if pyramid=2 and image
size is 258x258, the correlation will be done on 256x256 subframe and the 
extra input pixels will be ignored.

The underlying JPL Stereo code can only handle images up to 2048 x 2048.
If the image is larger than that, it is automatically downsampled until it
fits within 2048 x 2048.  The pyramid level is reduced as well, so that
the effective result is identical to what would have happened if JPL Stereo
could handle larger images (i.e. the downsizing is transparent).  However,
the pyramid level must be big enough to accommodate this; if it goes negative
the program will abend.

EXECUTION:
  
  marsjplstereo inp=(left.img, right.img) out=disparity.img params
or
  marsjplstereo inp=(left.img, right.img, lower.img) out=disparity.img) params

  left.img - left image of the stereo pair
  right.img - right image of the stereo pair
  lower.img - lower image for the trinocular stereo. Not used for binocular stereo
  disparity.img - output disparity map.  Can be a single 2-band file or two
      1-band files.
  parameters : see below.

NOTE. 
  Parameter space for this routine has not been explored fully. Some
comments on the default values and their ranges are given in the
parameter section. 

EXAMPLE

Convert images from CAHVOR space to CAHV and update camera model
information in the labels : 

  marscahv left.img left_cahv
  marscahv right.img right_cahv

Run the JPL Stereo algorithm with window size 15 : 

  marsjplstereo inp=(left_cahv, right_cahv) out=(disparity.img) window = 15

Convert from disparity to XYZ maps

  marsxyz inp=( left_cahv, right_cahv ) dispar=disparity.img out=xyz.img

OPERATION :
 
  This algorithm is descried in part in Matthies [1992]. Here's a quote
from the abstract of this paper. 
" .. The statistical and algorithmic aspects employ random field models 
of the disparity map, Bayesian formulations of single-scale matching,
and area-based image comparison. The implementation builds bandpass
pyramids and produces disparity maps... ".

DEVELOPER NOTES

All files in this package with the exception of marsjplstereo.* and
cmod_fp_stubs.h, are part of the correlator package obtained from Mark
Maimone.  Many have been modified to compile in the VICAR environment or
to fix bugs (e.g. more blobs than a short can handle, changed to long;
precision differences between Solaris and Linux).  However, an attempt has
been made to keep the changes to a minimum.  The original delivery is in
B. Deen's "mer" email folder if needed.


FUTURE WORK

- Loosen the ultra conservative approach to the Maximum
  Disparity. Currently the left edge of valid dispairty map values
  starts at the maximum disparity value.
- Allow min/maxdisp to be expressed in meters of range (for user convenience)
- Add parameter to turn off LRLOS (reverse correlation check) option.  That
  would only be useful for investigation of problems.
- Add ability to output disparity space for a given row, again to investigate
  bad correlations (SetRowsToSearch() in the correlator code).
- Separate horizontal/vertical window size parameters

.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
Left and right images of the stereo pair. There must two images for
input. Technically, the program does not care about the order of the
images, but the convention places the left image first.  Whichever is
first will be the reference image, i.e. the disparity map's geometry
will match the first image, with the map giving coordinates in the second.

A third input is possible for trinocular stereo but has not been tested.
Use at your own risk.

.VARI OUT
Output disparity map.  If one filename is given, a single 2-band image
will be created in REAL format, with the first band the Line disparity
and the second band the Sample disparity.  If two files are given, they
will both be single-band REAL images, where the first is Line disparity
and the second is Sample.

In all cases, the value of the pixel is the 1-based coordinate in the
second input image that matches the location of the pixel in the first
input image.  See MARSCORR for more file format details.

.VARI NAVTABLE
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using NAVTABLE it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

This parameter is usually not very useful for stereo pairs, but is
included for completeness.

.VARI PYRLEVEL
Pyramid level. Compute disparity at given Pyramid Level. Defaults
to 0.  The default will almost always be used in MIPL; low-resolution
results are rarely called for.

Comment from Mark Maimone:

0 is full resolution, 1 is half resolution in each dimension, 2 is
quarter, etc.  You typically get denser results at smaller resolution
(since camera calibration issues are less significant), but of course
the total number of range points typically drops. 

.VARI WINDOWSIZE 
Size of the correlation window in pixels. Default : 7. 

Tuning this parameter is an art. Typically, larger values give smooth 
maps at coarse resolution and not very sensitive to small
objects. Small values give finer resultion of disparity maps, but may 
not converge on some pixels. 

Correlation is only attempted if both of the image dimensions are at 
least 3 times as big as window size.  If that's not the case, the program
just writes out dn=0.0 for all pixels.

.VARI MINDISP
Minimum allowed disparity value. Default : 0.

Disparities less then MINDISP will be rejected.

.VARI MAXDISP    
Maximum disparity value. Default : 63

Disparities larger then MAXDISP will be rejected.

.VARI BLOBSIZE   
Sets minimum Blob Size.  The blob filter removes correlations on noisy
pixels, such as the sky in the image, by removing regions of connected
pixels that are smaller than the blob size.  Disparity differences
between adjacent pixels must be less than 1/4 pixel to be considered
part of a blob region.

Comment from Mark Maimone. 
A sanity check is that we eliminate small, standalone blobs from the
range image.  Leaving the size at -1 means it will be set to some
fixed ratio of the image size (4%).  I.e., you will never see
connected regions in the disparity image smaller than 4% of the image,
unless you reset this value to some number of pixels.

.VARI UNCERTAINTY
Enables the Uncertainty filter, and sets its value.  Normally this filtering
is not done.  If UNCERTAINTY is specified, the filter is enabled, with a
value of the parameter value.

The Uncertainty filter rejects points based on the slope of the correlation
peak.  This is loosely related to correlation quality.

A value of 256 corresponds to a 1.0 pixel uncertainty in disparity value.
A value of 128 might be a place to start with this parameter, given some
comments in the correlator code.  Lower values create a more stringent
filter; i.e. fewer values survive, which should mean that the remaining
values are of higher quality.

.VARI PERCENT
Since the underlying correlator accepts only byte data, halfword data
must be scaled to byte internally before correlating.  This is done
via a percent stretch (linear stretch based on histogram analysis).

This parameter specifies the percent of pixels to be saturated at
either end of the DN range.  It is a percentage, so the value ranges
from 0 to 100 (not 0 to 1).  It defaults to 0.4%, which is very close
to 1/256.  The binning process during byte conversion will ideally put
1/256 of the pixels in each bin, so a value of 0.4% treats the end bins
similar to all of the other bins.

.VARI SEPARATE
Normally all input images are lumped together into a single histogram
for the percent stretch calculation (see PERCENT).  Specifying SEPARATE
causes each image to be stretched independently, based on its own
histogram only.  This is useful for camera pairs whose overall brightness
levels aren't matched.  The correlator is rather sensitive to overall
brightness levels.

.VARI BAND
The vicar image band number for the input images.  Defaults to 1. If the 
specified band is bigger than the number of band in the image, the 1st band
will be processed. 

.VARI SEPARATION 
Set maximum Euclidean separation for trinocular stereo. DEFAULT = 0.2

Not used for binocular stereo. 

.VARI THRESHOLD  
Set uncertainty threshold. DEFAULT = 1.0; Range = [0:255]

Set maximum Pixel Threshold for merge. 

Not used for binocular stereo. 

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI MATCH_METHOD
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matchs with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matchs with unique id of the image.

.VARI MATCH_TOL
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if MATCH_METHOD=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI NOSITE
This parameter is not useful for MARSJPLSTEREO but is inherited with the
PIG library.  See e.g. MARSMAP for a description if necessary.

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
The DATA_SET_NAME typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_NAME.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
The DATA_SET_ID value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
DATA_SET_ID is an abbreviation of the DATA_SET_NAME.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_ID.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the RELEASE_ID is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword RELEASE_ID.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword PRODUCT_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword PRODUCER_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satelite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI RSF
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if <dir> is the name specified in the
RSF parameter, the following files will be searched for:

<dir>/master/<mission>_Master.svf
<dir>/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
This parameter is not useful for MARSJPLSTEREO but is inherited with the
PIG library.  See e.g. MARSMAP for a description if necessary.

.VARI COORD_INDEX
This parameter is not useful for MARSJPLSTEREO but is inherited with the
PIG library.  See e.g. MARSMAP for a description if necessary.

.VARI FIXED_SITE
This parameter is not useful for MARSJPLSTEREO but is inherited with the
PIG library.  See e.g. MARSMAP for a description if necessary.

.VARI SOLUTION_ID
Specifies which solution ID to use for pointng corrections.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.
