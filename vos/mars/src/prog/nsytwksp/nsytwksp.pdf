VICAR program NSYTWKSP

.HELP
PURPOSE:

NSYTWKSP computes a mask showing the workspace boundaries for the
InSight mission.  The boundaries are computed by comparing the XYZ
coordinates with precomputed polygons indicating the edges of the
workspace.

The output is a single-band BYTE image, containing a code 0-7 showing
which polygons the point is inside.  See below for values.

This program could easily by multimission-ized.

EXECUTION:

nsytwksp inp=data.xyz out=data.wss -seis
where:
data.xyz is an input 3-band image of type REAL with the X, Y and Z values
at that pixel in meters (the unit is actually irrelevant).

.PAGE
METHOD:

The actual core algorithm was developed by Steven Myint from Section 347.
It was then refactored to meet VICAR standards by Bob Deen.

The algorithm is simple: for each point, it checks if the XY coordinate
is within the boundary specified by the input polygon file.  Z is ignored.
The XYZ coordinate is converted to the coordinate system specified in
COORD first.

The files are different based on instrument: HP3 and SEIS (actually a
combination of SEIS and WTS).  Selection is made via a parameter.

.page
OUTPUT FORMAT:

The output is a 1-band file in BYTE format.

For HP3 the possible values are:

  0 = no data
  1 = outside HP3 boundary, or no data
  2 = HP3 footplane (footprint) boundary
  3 = n/a
  4 = IDA grapple workspace --- IDA grapple kinematically reachable zone for
      HP3 deployment
  5 = nominal (IDA grapple workspace) zone for HP3 deployment
  6 = inside HP3 grapple point boundary, but ICC view partially occluded
  7 = inside HP3 grapple point boundary, but more maneuvering required for 
      collision prevention 

For SEIS/WTS the possible values are:

  0 = no data
  1 = outside all SEIS/WTS areas, or no data
  2 = WTS footplane (footprint) boundary
  3 = SEIS footplane (footprint) boundary
  4 = IDA grapple workspace --- IDA grapple kinematically reachable zone for 
      SEIS/WTS deployment
  5 = nominal (IDA grapple workspace) zone for SEIS/WTS deployment
  6 = inside SEIS/WTS grapple point boundary, but ICC view partially occluded
  7 = inside SEIS/WTS grapple point boundary, but more maneuvering required for 
      collision prevention

The value 5 is assigned to the "best" workspace, in order to maintain
consistency across all InSight masks.  The values above 5 are
technically acceptable for placement, but are sub-optimal due to their
constraints.  The goodness program will accept all of 5-7 as "good".

Note: it is assumed the polygons strictly nest, with higher numbers above
being smaller than previous polygons.  If not, the highest number wins
(in other words, polygons are traversed in order from highest to lowest, and
once a number is assigned to a given pixel, no other polyons are checked).

.PAGE
POLYGON FILES:

The program reads polygon vertices from five polygon files provided by
Won Kim (347). These files are found using the standard MARS_CONFIG_PATH
mechanism in the "param_files" directory.  The files are:

param_files/NSYT_wksp_hp3_boundary.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_hp3_grapple_kinematic.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_hp3_grapple_nominal.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_hp3_grapple_ICC.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_hp3_grapple_maneuvering.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_wts_boundary.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_seis_boundary.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_seis-wts_grapple_kinematic.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_seis-wts_grapple_nominal.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_seis-wts_grapple_ICC.txt
param_files/NSYT_wksp_seis-wts_grapple_maneuvering.txt

where "NSYT" is actually the host ID (NSYT for flight, NSYTTBC for the
testbed, etc).

The polygon files may be replaced with different ones if the lander ends
up with a significant tilt (because the tilt affects how the grapple hangs).

identifier assigned to a data
product by its producer.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier
of an entity associated with the
production a data set.

with the production of a data set.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Input files contain the XYZ coordinates. If three filenames are given,
they all should be single band files each containing X, Y and Z values
in that order.  If only one filename is given, it should be a 3-band
file with bands in (X,Y,Z) order.

The input files are in REAL (float) format.

.VARI OUT
Output file containing the mask.

The file will be in 1-band BYTE format.  See "OUTPUT FORMAT" in the main
help for the file format.

.VARI INST
Chooses which instrument to use.  Based on this, the proper config file
is loaded to obtain the polygons.

.VARI OUTSIDE_DN
DN to use for pixels that have an XYZ value but are outside of all polygons.
Default is 1, which distinguishes outside vs. no-value cases.

.VARI WTS_OFF
There are radial and cross-radial offsets between the WTS and SEIS, because
the grapples are not coaxial in the nominal placement.  The WTS position is
thus offset by an amount determined in the WTS_OFF parameter. WTS_OFF parameter
has 1 or 2 valid values. The first value defines radial offset along the
direction back to the Lander(IDA) frame origin, and the second value defines
cross-radial offset along the direction perpendicular to radial direction.
Radial offset defaults to 0.05 meters, and cross-radial offset defaults to 0.
THe cross-radial offset is 0 if it is unspecified. Consider positive toward the 
Lander frame origin for radial and to the right (+Y when looking down +X) for 
cross-radial. Both radial and cross-radial offsets are applied after WTS
rotations (instrument clocking and rotations due to tether) are done.
See the NSYTTILT help for details. 

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projects to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI NOSITE
Disables all label-derived parameters to the Site mechanism which underlies
coordinate systems.  This forces all sites to be identical, with all rotations
and offsets set the same.  In the case of MPF or Mars 98, this disables
the lander quaternion and offset (sets them to identity and 0, respectively).
This option should not be used with images taken from different vantage
points (e.g. the spacecraft moved, or mixing a lander and a rover) or
invalid results will be obtained.  The use of this option invalidates the
Fixed coordinate frame; any values reported in the Fixed frame will not
correctly reflect the orientation of the lander/rover.

Obviously, this option should be rarely used; it is intended for when the
image labels defining the site are invalid or inconsistent.

.VARI DATA_SET_NAME
The DATA_SET_NAME typically identifies the instrument that acquired the
data, the target of that instrument, and the processing level of the data.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_NAME.

.VARI DATA_SET_ID
The DATA_SET_ID value for a given data set or product is constructed
according to flight project naming conventions.  In most cases the
DATA_SET_ID is an abbreviation of the DATA_SET_NAME.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword DATA_SET_ID.

.VARI RELEASE_ID
When a data set is released incrementally, such as every three months during
a mission, the RELEASE_ID is updated each time part of the data set is released.
For each mission(or host id if multiple spacecrafts), the first release of a data
set should have a value of "0001".
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword RELEASE_ID.

.VARI PRODUCT_ID
Specifies a permanent, unique identifier assigned to a data product by
its producer. Most commonly, it is the filename minus the extension.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION,
keyword PRODUCT_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_ID
Specifies the unique identifier of an entity associated with the
production of a data set. This value is copied to the output label,
property IDENTIFICATION, keyword PRODUCER_ID.

.VARI PRODUCER_INST
Specifies the identity of a university, research center, NASA center or other
institution associated with the production of a data set.
This value is copied to the output label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword
PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_NAME
Specifies a target.  The target may be a planet, satelite, ring, region, feature,
asteroid or comet.  This value is copied to the output label, property
IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI TARGET_TYPE
Specifies the type of a named target. This value is copied to the output
label, property IDENTIFICATION, keyword TARGET_NAME.

.VARI RSF
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if <dir> is the name specified in the
RSF parameter, the following files will be searched for:

<dir>/master/<mission>_Master.svf
<dir>/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
The coordinate system in which the polygons are expressed.  The input XYZ
values will be translated to this coordinate system.

The interpretation of the values is dependent on the mission.  Some
representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame.  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also FIXED_SITE for rover missions).
Instrument - (default) The "natural" frame for the instrument 
    (of the first input image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, COORD_INDEX specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, COORD_INDEX
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

.VARI COORD_INDEX
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, coord_index specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by COORD_INDEX.

Generally COORD_INDEX defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

.VARI FIXED_SITE
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The FIXED_SITE parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, FIXED_SITE defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must FIXED_SITE be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the RSF parameter.

.VARI SOLUTION_ID
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for COORD_INDEX
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.
