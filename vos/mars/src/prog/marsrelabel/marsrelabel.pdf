.TITLE
VICAR program MARSRELABEL.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To update certain Label Groups.  Currently support updating or adding
Coordinate_Systems, Camera_Models and Pointing Models definitions

This is currently a MER and MSL/M20 specific program, for coordinate frame
updates.  Camera Model and Pointing Model updates are multimission.

The output file will have the same image data as the input, only the label
will be changed.

Only single image input is supported which produces single output file.
If the list of files is given as input, only the first file in the list
will be used for processing, the rest will be descarded.

Optionally, the camera model can be written to a separate file (in the
format used by Todd Litwin's camera model programs).

Also optionally, the instrument az/el in the ROVER and SITE derived geometry
groups can be updated.

EXECUTION:

marsrelabel inp=input.img out=output.img -cm -pm

Systems in appropriate
Label Property Groups.

that in COORD.

Path used to find
configuration/calibration
files.

Rover State File(s) to use.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
Turns on debugging of RSF
parameter.

.VARI COORD
Coordinate system to use.
Not used by this program.

.VARI COORD_INDEX
Coordinate system index for
some COORD/mission combos.
Not used by this program.

.VARI FIXED_SITE
Which site is FIXED for
rover missions.
Not used by this program.

.VARI FIXED_NAME
Overrides what CS type is
allowed for the FIXED frame

.VARI NAVTABLE
Corrected navigation
filename.

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-
specific pointing
method to use

.VARI MATCH_METHOD
Specifies a method
for pointing corrections.

.VARI MATCH_TOL
Tolerance value for
matching pointing params
in pointing corrections file.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Input image.

.VARI OUT
Output image.

.VARI OUT_CM
Optional filename for the output camera model.  It will be written in a
format compatible with Todd Litwin's library of CAHV camera model functions.

.VARI CM
If CM is set, Camera_Model property group gets updated using calibration
camera models.  Based on label's info we point, scale, shift those calibration
models exactly the same way flight software is doing it.

.VARI PM
If PM is set, Pointing_Model gets updated/created in the label 
in the appropriate property group.

.VARI CS
If CS is set, coordinate system property labels gets updated.  There weren't be
any changes, unless Rover State File is specified using RSF parameter.

Note that only the mobility-related coordinate systems will be rewritten.
This consists of Site, Local Level, and the equivalent of Rover frame for
the given mission.  Other frames, such as arm, arm tool, mast, camera, etc.
will not be updated, since there is no mechanism to change their value anyway.

.VARI ALL
Equivalent to setting to update CM,PM and CS

.VARI CHANGE_CM_CS
If set, causes the cmod to be expressed in the coordinate system specified in
the COORD parameter, rather than the "natural" CS for the instrument. 
Does nothing if -CM (or -ALL) is not also specified.

.VARI NO_CM_XFER
Normally, if -CM is specified to update the camera model, the camera model
metadata (primarily MODEL_TRANSFORM_VECTOR and MODEL_TRANSFORM_QUATERNION)
are transferred over from the input model.  If this flag is specified,
this transfer is suppressed.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI AZEL
Turns on az/el recomputation.  This computes, or re-computes, the
INSTRUMENT_AZIMUTH and INSTRUMENT_ELEVATION labels in the ROVER_ and
SITE_DERIVED_GEOMETRY groups based on the current camera model.  It is
generally a good idea to update these fields if the cmod is changed.

.VARI ROVER_CS_NAME
Coordnate system name for rover frame for -azel.  Defaults to ROVER, which
should be sufficient for most purposes.  Setting it to -- disables writing
the rover values while still potentially writing site values.

.VARI SITE_CS_NAME
Coordnate system name for site frame for -azel.  Defaults to SITE, which
should be sufficient for most purposes.  Setting it to -- disables writing
the site values while still potentially writing rover values.

.VARI RSF
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if <dir> is the name specified in the
RSF parameter, the following files will be searched for:

<dir>/master/<mission>_Master.svf
<dir>/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI COORD_INDEX
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI FIXED_SITE
This parameter is ignored by marsrad.  The parameter exists for
compatibility with subroutines used by other programs (see e.g. marsmap).

.VARI FIXED_NAME
Overrides what CS type is allowed for the fixed frame.  Normally this is the
lowest-numbered SITE_FRAME.  However, the PIG library actually looks for any
CS with only one index as a potential fixed frame.  This causes issues with
the M20 helicopter, where e.g. the HELI_G_FRAME also has only one index.  This
parameter allows the user to force the fixed frame to SITE_FRAME.

.VARI NAVTABLE
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using NAVTABLE it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving you a better registered mosaic.

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI MATCH_METHOD
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

.VARI MATCH_TOL
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections
file.  Used if MATCH_METHOD=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....
