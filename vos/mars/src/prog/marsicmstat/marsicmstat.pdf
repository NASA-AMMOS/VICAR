.TITLE
VICAR program MARSICMSTAT

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Simple program to report various statistics from an ICM (or correlation)file.

It pulls a certain set of information needed by the CRISP server from labels
and makes them available via output variables (use v2param to access).

Additionally (and optionally), it determines the bounding box of non-zero
data for the input image.  It looks at only band 1 for efficiency, assuming
all the other bands' non-zero status is the same.

EXECUTION:

marsicmstat inp=disp.imp

then:

set count = `v2param corr_count`

or just:

cat `v2param -file`

.PAGE
METHOD:
Simple search though all pixels for the bounding box.  Uses the label API
to pull output label items.

.VARI NAVTABLE
Corrected navigation filename.
If marsnav was run on the input images it created a table of corrected
pointing parameters. If you refer to this table using NAVTABLE it
will override the pointing parameters (e.g. azimuth and elevation) in the
picture labels, giving different (and presumably better) output coordinates.

.VARI CONFIG_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to look for configuration
and calibration files.  Environment variables are allowed in the list
(and may themselves contain colon-separated lists).  The directories are
searched in order for each config/cal file when it is loaded.  This allows
multiple projectes to be supported simultaneously, and allows the user to
override any given config/cal file.  Note that the directory structure below
the directories specified in this path must match what the project expects.
For example, Mars 98 expects flat fields to be in a subdirectory named
"flat_fields" while Mars Pathfinder expects them to be directly in the
directory specified by the path (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

.VARI MATCH_METHOD
Specifies a method for pointing corrections.

Loose method matches with pointing parameters of the image.
Tight method matches with unique id of the image.

.VARI MATCH_TOL
Tolerance value for matching pointing parameters in the pointing corrections file.
Used if MATCH_METHOD=LOOSE
Default value is pretty arbitrary, though seems to work well so far....

.VARI POINT_METHOD
Specifies a mission-specific pointing method to use.  Normally this
parameter is not used, in which case the "default" pointing methods
are used.  Some missions may have special, or alternate, pointing
methods available, which are indicated by this string (for example,
backlash models, using arm joint angles instead of x/y/z/az/el, etc).
A substring search is used, so multiple methods (where that makes sense)
can be specified by separating the keywords with commas.

Note that nav files created using one pointing method will most likely
not be compatible with a mosaic created using a different pointing method.

The methods available vary per mission, but some methods available at
the time of this writing are:

BACKLASH : Mars 98 SSI only.  Selects a backlash pointing model,
which adjusts the telemetered azimuth and elevation values based on
knowledge of the camera's mechanical backlash and the direction the
motor was travelling when the image was taken.

.VARI RSF
Rover State File.  This is a list of filenames to load containing
Rover State information.  These files contain position and orientation
information for a rover (or other mobile spacecraft) at various sites.
They are in XML format.  See the "Rover Motion Counter (RMC) Master File SIS"
for details on these files.

Rover State Files have a priority order.  The files listed first have
the highest priority.

Environment variables may be used in the list.

For MER, if a directory is specified, then that directory is searched for
RMC Master files and any found are loaded.  The directory structure and
filename convention is covered in the RMC SIS.  The directory specified
is the one containing "master", so if <dir> is the name specified in the
RSF parameter, the following files will be searched for:

<dir>/master/<mission>_Master.svf
<dir>/master/<mission>_Site_<n>_Master.rvf

The name of each file loaded is printed to the stdout log for reference.

.VARI DEBUG_RSF
If enabled, this causes the internal database of RMC locations to be
printed out to the stdout log.  This is after the RSF files have been
loaded and the coordinate systems read from the input label(s).

.VARI COORD
Specifies the coordinate system to use to interpret the XYZ value.

The interpretation of the values is dependent on the mission.  Some
representative missions are listed here:

Fixed - The Fixed frame (default).  This is the ultimate reference frame
    (see also FIXED_SITE for rover missions).
Instrument - The "natural" frame for the instrument (of the first input
    image).  MPF: Lander or Rover; M98: MVACS; MER: Rover.
Site - A major Site frame.  For rover missions, COORD_INDEX specifies which
    Site frame to use.  Non-rover missions treat this as Fixed.
Rover - An instance of the Rover frame.  For rover missions, COORD_INDEX
    specifies which instance of the rover frame to use.  Non-rover mission
    use the spacecraft frame (e.g. Lander for M98).
Local_Level - An instance of a Local Level frame.  This is typically
    coincident with the Rover frame (in XYZ) but oriented toward North
    like the Site and Fixed frames.  For MER, this is an instance of a
    Drive index move.

.VARI COORD_INDEX
The index specifies which instance of a coordinate system to use.  It is
currently applicable only to rover-based missions, but could have other
uses.  The index is equivalent to the Rover Motion Counter (RMC) for MER
and FIDO.

For MER/FIDO, there are many Site frames.  Each is numbered with a single
index.  For Site Frames, coord_index specifies which to use.  Likewise,
there are many Local_Level and Rover frames, corresponding to values of
the RMC.  The multiple instances of this frame are selected by COORD_INDEX.

Generally COORD_INDEX defaults sensibly so you don't usually need to
specify it.  It will default to the instance used by the first input.

.VARI FIXED_SITE
Specifies which major Site is the "Fixed" Site for this run.

Historically, MPF and M98 had a single "Surface Fixed" frame which never
moved, and which all other coordinate system frames were referenced to.
With the advent of long-range rovers (such as MER and FIDO), that became
insufficient.  The rover traverses far enough that errors in knowledge of
coordinate system offset and orientation become unacceptable.

For this reason, a system of major Sites was introduced.  Periodically
during the mission, a Site frame is declared.  This then becomes the
reference frame for all activities until the next Site is declared.
References are kept local, and errors don't propogate across Sites.

However, if images from more than one Site are combined together, the
Site's must be placed relative to each other.  Therefore a single reference
frame is still needed to combine different sites.

The FIXED_SITE parameter controls which of the major Site frames is
the reference ("fixed") site for this program run.  This fixed frame
can vary in different program runs, but is constant throughout one
execution.

If not specified, FIXED_SITE defaults to the minimum Site number (i.e.
lowest numbered, or earliest chronologically) used in all input images.
Normally this default is sufficient; rarely must FIXED_SITE be specified.

One or more Rover State Files must usually be specified in order to combine
image from more than one Site.  These describe the relationship between
sites.  See the RSF parameter.

.VARI SOLUTION_ID
Specifies which solution ID to use when specifying the coordinate system.

There are potentially many different definitions for the same coordinate
system.  These are identified via a unique Solution ID.  If this parameter
is given, only the specified solution's definition is searched for.  Without
it, the "best" available solution is chosen.

It is extremely rare that this parameter should be needed.  The default
will be sufficient in almost every case.

Note that the current MER implementation requires that a value for COORD_INDEX
also be provided, in order for this parameter to take effect.
