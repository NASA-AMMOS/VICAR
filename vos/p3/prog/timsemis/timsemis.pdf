VICAR PROCESS TIMSEMIS
.HELP
PURPOSE:
     TIMSEMIS is a program to generate spectral emissivity images from
calibrated TIMS data. The input dataset should be the 6 calibrated (IRAD or
GRAD) TIMS channels. The first output will contain the 6 spectral emittance
images, while the second output will contain the temperature image.
     Three algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first method,
called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified constant
emittance value. The default sets Channel 6 to 0.95. The temperature is computed
based upon the radiance and given emittance of the reference channel, then the 
other five spectral emittances are computed, using this temperature.
     The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes the
highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the six spectral
emittances, based upon the computed temperature.
     The third method, TWOCHAN, estimates the temperature by assuming that
the emissivity is exactly equal in the two channels whose blackbody fit
emissivities are most nearly equal.  The kinetic temperature is then
computed to fit the ratio of the radiances of those two channels, then each 
of the emissivities is calculated.
.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
TIMS calibrated image (RAD)
.VARI OUT
(1) Spectral emittance image
(2) Temperature image
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR2 output
size field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI REFCHAN
(For REFCHAN mode only)
The channel to be used as the
reference channel. Valid: (1:6)
.VARI DATE
Date of data acquisition. Used
to override the date in the
VICAR label (yymmdd)
.VARI E
The emittance assumed for the
reference channel (REFCHAN or
TWOCHAN mode); or the maximum
emittance (BBFIT mode)
.VARI MODE
REFCHAN, TWOCHAN, or BBFIT
.VARI ORG
Organization of output dataset
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The file containing all six bands of a calibrated TIMS image, using the
WATTS units.
.VARI OUT
     The first output dataset is a halfword image of all six bands of TIMS
emittance data, scaled such that an emittance of 1.0 is 10,000 DN.
     The second output dataset is a halfword temperature image, where each DN
corresponds to 0.01 degree Celsius. 0 DN corresponds to 0 degrees C.
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will calibrate
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,638)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI REFCHAN
	The channel to which the other bands are to be referenced, in
	the case of REFCHAN mode, is input through this parameter.
	The default is band six is used. In the BBFIT mode, this parameter
        is ignored.
		Example: REFCHAN = 5
.VARI DATE
	TIMSEMIS uses the date of data acquisition to determine the proper
	calibration coefficients.  If defaulted, the date in the VICAR 
	label is used. This parameter is needed only if the VICAR label
	is incorrect, or if an abnormal calibration set is to be used.
.VARI E
     In the REFCHAN mode, the spectral emittance of the reference channel is
set to a constant value, given by this parameter.
     In the BBFIT mode, spectral emittances are computed so that the maximum
of the six emittance values is equal to the value of E.
     In the TWOCHAN mode, the spectral emittance of the two channels with the
most 
.VARI MODE
     Two algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first method,
called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified constant
emittance value. The default sets Channel 6 to 0.95. The temperature is computed
based upon the radiance and given emittance of the reference channel, then the 
other five spectral emittances are computed, using this temperature.
     The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes the
highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the six spectral

.VARI ORG
ORG specifies the organizational format of the first (emissivity) output 
dataset. BIL (the default) and BSQ are supported.
