.TITLE
VICAR Program SPECTRUM
.HELP
PURPOSE:
SPECTRUM produces a plot of DN versus channel or wavelength for a single 3-D 
pixel, or of the mean DN for a region specified by one or more rectangular
areas. The plot may be directed to an x-window (via IDL), or to a
PostScript printer.

.LEVEL2
.vari INP
The first value of INP is the name of the input image file.  A second input
file may be used to supply the wavelengths of the input channels.  This 
second input file should be an ASCII file (no VICAR labels) in the form of
a table.  The wavelength values must be the first column (there need not be
any other columns), and there must be one row per channel.
.vari BANDS
BANDS specifies the starting band desired, and the number of bands to be 
processed.  If the first channel in the dataset is not Channel 1, the 
parameter ST_CHAN should also be specified.
.vari SB
This parameter denotes the first channel in the dataset to be included in the 
plotting. If the first channel in the dataset is not Channel 1, the parameter 
ST_CHAN should also be specified.
.vari NB
This parameter denotes the number of bands to be included in the plot.
.vari LINE
This is the line number of the pixel to be plotted. If the spectrum of a region
is wanted, the AREA parameter is used and this parameter is ignored.
.vari SAMPLE
This is the sample number of the pixel to be plotted. If the spectrum of a 
region is wanted, the AREA parameter is used and this parameter is ignored.
.vari XAXIS
XAXIS indicates the full scale limits of the x-axis. If defaulted, the program
chooses limits that completely span the range of the data plotted. In some
cases, the program will adjust (widen) the user specified limits, in order to
place the tic marks at reasonable values.
.vari YAXIS
YAXIS indicates the full scale limits of the y-axis. If defaulted, the program
chooses limits that completely span the range of the data plotted. In some
cases, the program will adjust (widen) the user specified limits, in order to
place the tic marks at reasonable values.
     In addition to the mean spectral values, the one standard deviation range
is also plotted, ifthe AREA option is chosen.
.VARIABLE XLABEL
XLABEL is the title for the x-axis on plots printed on the laser printer. It
is not used on any other plots. The default is "Channel".
.VARIABLE YLABEL
YLABEL is the title for the y-axis on plots printed on the laser printer. It
is not used on any other plots. The default is "DN".
.VARIABLE AREA
If the average spectum of a region is desired, it may be specified using the
AREA parameter.  Up to fifty rectangular areas, specified by SL,SS,NL,NS, may
be used to form the average spectrum. The areas need not be contiguous, and if
two area overlap, those pixels are counted twice. If the AREA parameter is used,
the LINE and SAMPLE parameters are ignored.
.VARIABLE SENSOR
The channel wavelengths of certain sensors are known to this program. By 
specifying the name of the sensor, DN values are plotted against wavelengths
(in micrometers) rather than channel number.  If the sensor is not specified
or not known, the channel number is used.  As of April 2,1991, AVIRIS, TIMS,
TM, 87AVIRIS, 90AVIRIS, and GEOSCAN wavelengths are known to this program.
.VARIABLE ST_CHAN
This parameter indicates the channel number of the first channel to be plotted.
It must be specified if the first channel in the input dataset is not Channel 1
of the sensor.  If defaulted, ST_CHAN is assumed to be equal to the starting
band (SB).
.VARIABLE CUMUL
Specifying this parameter produces a plot of the cumulative DN values for the
spectrum, and not the spectrum itself.
.VARIABLE TITLE
This parameter allows the user to place a title or line of annotation on the
printed plot, session log, and standard output, if such products are produced.
It may be up to 40 characters in length.
.VARIABLE PRINT
Specifying this parameter causes a table of the spectral values to be printed
to the user and in the SESSION.LOG
.VARIABLE SIGMA
In the default mode (SIGMA) for the spectrum of an area, the one standard 
deviation envelope about the mean spectrum is plotted.  If NOSIGMA is 
specified, this envelope is not plotted.  If the spectrum is for a single 
point, rather than an area, this keyword has no relevance, and is ignored.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
This parameter is specified if the user wishes to exclude zero valued pixels
from the compuation of the mean and stadard deviation.
.VARIABLE MODE
If WINDOW is specified (the default), spectrum plots the graph in an IDL
Xwindow. If PSCRIPT is specified, no interactive plotting is done, but a
hardcopy PostScript plot is made.  If NOPLOT is specified, printing is enabled,
plotting is disabled, and there are no interactive pauses.
