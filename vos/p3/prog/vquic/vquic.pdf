VICAR/IBIS Program "vquic"
.HELP
PURPOSE

    "vquic" transfers data from an ascii text file to an IBIS interface
(tabular) file.  The data can be both numeric and character.



EXECUTION:

vquic INPUT=DATA.TXT  OUT=DATA.INT  NCOL=4  LCOL=1500 FORMAT="(1X,F5.3,A4)"

vquic DATA2.TXT DATA2.INT   COLS=(1,4,5)


  Each line in the input ascii text file is transfered to the corresponding 
row in the interface file.  The input data may be either free formatted 
numbers, in which case the FORMAT parameter is defaulted, or may be 
formatted characters and/or numbers, in which case the appropriate 
Fortran format statement must be specified.  If free formatting is used
the data separators may be spaces, tabs, or commas.

  The output file is an IBIS interface file with NCOL columns and LCOL rows.  
If NCOL is defaulted then it will be found from the maximum column number
specified with the COLS parameter.  If there are less than LCOL lines in 
the input file then the remaining rows will be filled with zeros.  If there 
are more than LCOL lines then the remaining lines will not be read.   
If LCOL is defaulted then the LCOL will be found from the length of the 
input file. 

  The COLS parameter specifies the columns that will receive the data.
If there are more numbers on a line than columns, the remaining numbers 
will be ignored.  If there are less numbers then if free formatting is 
being used the missing numbers will be read from the next line, otherwise 
zeros will be put in for the missing numbers.

  If a input line generates a read error then a warning will be printed
and zeros will be transfered for the remaining columns in the row.


RESTRICTIONS:

The maximum input line length is 255 characters.
The maximum number of columns in the interface file is 100.
