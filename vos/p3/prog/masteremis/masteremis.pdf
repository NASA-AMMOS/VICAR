VICAR PROCESS MASTEREMIS
.HELP
PURPOSE:
     MASTEREMIS is a program to generate spectral emissivity images from
calibrated MASTER data. The primary input dataset should be the 10 calibrated
(IRAD or GRAD) MASTER TIR channels. The first output will contain the 10
spectral emittance images, while the second output will contain the temperature
image.
     Three algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first 
method, called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified 
constant emittance value. The default sets Channel 50 to 0.95. The temperature
is computed based upon the radiance and given emittance of the reference 
channel, then the other nine spectral emittances are computed, using this 
temperature.
     The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes the
highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the ten spectral
emittances, based upon the computed temperature.
     The third method, called 8CHANFIT, is the same as BBFIT, except that
Bands 41 and 50 are not used when searching for the channel to set to the
specified emittance.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The first input dataset shall contain the upwelling radiance at surface data 
for the ten MASTER TIR channels (Channels 41 to 50), in units of Watts 
per sqare meter per steradian per micrometer.  Normally, this is the output 
dataset from MASTERTIR. 

The second file should be the MASTER TIR temperature to radiance lookup 
table for the spectral response calibration that is in effect for the date
of data acquisition.  These files are typically located in the directory 

          $V2TOP/luts

and have names of the form

         lut.master.rad.YEAR.MON

The third file should be the MASTER TIR radiance to temperature lookup 
table for the spectral response calibration that is in effect for the date
of data acquisition.  These files are typically located in the directory 

          $V2TOP/luts

and have names of the form

         lut.master.temp.YEAR.MON
.VARI OUT
     The first output dataset is a halfword image of all ten bands of MASTER
TIR emittance data, scaled such that an emittance of 1.0 is 10,000 DN.
     The second output dataset is a halfword temperature image, where each DN
corresponds to 0.01 degree Celsius. 0 DN corresponds to 0 degrees C.
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will calibrate
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,500)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI REFCHAN
In the REFCHAN mode, this is the channel which is set to the value given
by the parameter EMIS.  In the BBFIT mode, this parameter is ignored. The
user may specify either the MASTER channel number (41 through 50), or the
input file band number (1 through 10).
		Example: REFCHAN = 5
                     or, REFCHAN = 45
(both have the same result.)
.VARI FITCHAN
In the BBFIT or 8CHANFIT mode, the Nth highest evissivity is assigned the 
value given by the parameter EMIS.  The FITCHAN parameter defines N.  That
is, for the default (FITCHAN=1), the highest emissivity is assigned the value
of EMIS.  If FITCHAN were set to 3, then the third highest emissivity would 
be set to EMIS.
.VARI EMIS
     In the REFCHAN mode, the spectral emittance of the reference channel is
set to a constant value, given by this parameter.
     In the BBFIT or 8CHANFIT mode, spectral emittances are computed so that 
the maximum of the emittance values is equal to the value of EMIS.
.VARI MODE
    Three algorithms (MODEs) have presently been implemented. The first method,
called REFCHAN, sets a specified reference channel to a specified constant
emittance value. The default sets Channel 50 to 0.95. The temperature is 
computed based upon the radiance and given emittance of the reference channel,
then the other nine spectral emittances are computed, using this temperature.
    The second method, called BBFIT, assumes that the highest spectral
emittance is at a user-specified level (default = 0.95). It then computes the
highest temperature consistent with this assumption, and the ten spectral
emittances that are consistent with the computed temperature.
    The third method, called 8CHANFIT, is the same as BBFIT, except that
Bands 41 and 50 are not used when searching for the channel to set to the
specified emittance.
.VARI ORG
ORG specifies the organizational format of the first (emissivity) output 
dataset. BIL (the default) and BSQ are supported.
