VICAR Program TGEOMINV
.HELP
PURPOSE
      TGEOMINV is a program to produce the inverse transformation map, for
use by the program TGEOM2.  That is, if the input file to TGEOMINV can be used
to geometrically correct (register) ImageA to ImageB, then the output file
from TGEOMINV can be used to register ImageB to ImageA.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Rectification dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
Inverted rectification dataset
.VARIABLE NLOUT
Number of lines output 
.VARIABLE NSOUT
Number of samples output 
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input file must be a rectification dataset in the format that is
output by TGEOM1.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output file will be a rectification dataset that is appropriate for
performing the reverse (master to slave) registration to the one specified
by the input dataset.  It will have the format that is appropriate for use
in TGEOM2
.VARIABLE NLOUT
Number of lines in the output file
.VARIABLE NSOUT
Number of samples in the output file
