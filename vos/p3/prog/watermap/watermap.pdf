.HELP
      WATERMAP is a program to compute the atmospheric moisture content image,
starting with the CIBR image and a 2 column table of moisture contents and
CIBR values.  WATERMAP finds the values of a and b that fits the table values 
to a curve of the form
                                          b
                       CIBR = exp(-a*WATER )

Then, using the inverse of this equation, it computes the water image from
the CIBR map.
       Operationally, this is done by means of a lookup table of the possible
input values.  The data type of the input image may be byte, halfword, or 
fullword, but the values must fall within the range of 1 to 32767.  The 
parameter SCALE is used to rescale the data into the units used in the fitted 
table.
       The rescaled CIBR values should all fall within the range 0 to 1.  If
a value less than 0 is encountered, it is marked in the output with a value of 
99999.0.  Input values that are greater than 1 are set to -1 in the output.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
     Two inputs are required.  The first input is a VICAR labelled image of the 
CIBR.  It may be byte, halfword, or integer, but must not contain negative 
values or values greater than 32767.
     The second input is a table (ASCII file, not a VICAR labelled file) of two
columns.  The first column should contain the values of water content, while the
second column should have the corresponding CIBR values.  Entries that have CIBR
values outside the range 0 to 1, or water values less than or equal to 0, are
discarded.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output dataset is an image of water content.  It has a data type of real,
regardless of the input data type.  The image will have the same units as the
water column in the input table.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the computation is to take place.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be procesed
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) on each line
.VARIABLE SCALE
This value is multiplied to all pixels prior to applying the CIBR
transformation.  It must be specified to get the units of the CIBR image
to match the units used to determine the fit parameters.
