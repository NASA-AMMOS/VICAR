VICAR/IBIS Program RASTOGRAF

PURPOSE
     RASTOGRAF is a program used to convert from a line image in raster format
into an IBIS Graphics I file consisting of line segment information. All pixels 
not equal to the BACKground value are considered as parts of lines and are 
included as vectors. For 3-D files, the third value is the DN of the line.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input raster image
.VARIABLE OUT
Output Graphics I file
.VARIABLE SIZE
VICAR size field
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE DIM
Dimension of the graphics file
.VARIABLE BACK
DN value of background pixels
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input image, which is a standard VICAR raster image. In the image, pixel
values not equal to the BACKground value are considered lines, and are 
converted into vectors. 
.VARIABLE OUT
Output Graphics I file.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the copy is to take place.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line, the first image line to be examined for output vectors.
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample, the leftmost image pixel to be examined for output vectors.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines to be examined for output vectors.
.VARIABLE NS
Number of pixels per line to be examined for output vectors.
.VARIABLE DIM
DIM specifies the number of dimensions of the output graphics file, either
2 or 3.  If DIM=3, the third dimension is used to store the DN of the line.
.VARIABLE BACK
BACK specifies the DN of background pixels. All pixels that are not of this
DN are included as part of an output vector.
