PURPOSE:
BOXFLT2 applies a low-pass filter to an input image by taking the local
mean of all pixels contained within a prescribed window centered at
each pixel of the input image.  This mean then replaces the input value.
A highpass option is available which replaces each input value with the
difference between the input and the local mean, plus a constant DC-level
offset.

EXECUTION:

Examples
	BOXFLT2  INP  OUT  NLW=21  NSW=451

	This example performs a lowpass filter of size 451 samples by 21
	lines on the input. Reflection is performed at image boundaries.

	BOXFLT2  INP  OUT  NLW=101  NSW=1  'HIGHPASS  DCLEVEL=90  'CYCLE

	This examples performs a highpass filter of size 101 lines by 1
	sample with an output DCLEVEL of 90, performing cycling at the
	image boundaries.  (The omitted keywords are FILTER and EDGE,
	respectively.)

OPERATION:
BOXFLT2 performs a lowpass filter operation by taking the local mean of
all pixels contained within a prescribed window of NLW by NSW dimensions
centered at each pixel of the input image.  This mean then replaces the 
input value.  If the HIGHPASS option is specified, then the difference
between the input and the local mean plus a constant DC-level offset
replaces the input value. 

BOXFLT2 provides the user with the choice of using "reflection", "cycling"
(wrap-around), or "extending" (repeat the edge pixel) at image boundaries.
In the default case, image reflection is used, and may be depicted as above
in the EXECUTION section.  If cycling is desired, where the left boundary of
the image is equivalent to the right boundary, and the upper boundary is
equivalent to the lower boundary.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE NSW
NSW is the width in pixels of the box filter.  It must be less than
twice the image width in pixels and defaults to 11.
.VARIABLE NLW
NLS is the length in lines of the box filter.  It must be less than
twice the image length in pixels and defaults to 11.
.VARIABLE FILTER
FILTER=HIGHPASS specifies that the output is to be the highpass, rather than
the lowpass, version of the input, i.e., OUT = IN - LOW + DCLEVEL.
The default is lowpass filtering.
.VARIABLE DCLEVEL
Specifies (for highpass filter) the constant to be added to the 
difference (IN-LOW) in the highpass output image.  Default is 128.
.VARIABLE EDGE
Specifies image handling at image boundaries.  Setting EDGE=CYCLE or 'CYCLE
causes the program to treat the image as if it wrapped around at boundaries
in both directions.  'LCYCLE and 'SCYCLE cause wrap-around in the line and
sample direction only, respectively.  'EXTEND causes the edge pixel to be
repeated for all locations beyond the boundaries. The default is for the 
program to reflect the image at the boundaries.
