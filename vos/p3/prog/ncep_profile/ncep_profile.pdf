.TITLE
VICAR Program NCEP_PROFILE
.HELP
PURPOSE:
 
      NCEP_PROFILE is a VICAR program to perform an 8 point weighted
interpolation (in both space and time) of NCEP GDAS global assimilation 
model data.
 
.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input VICAR labelled NCEP global
data files.
(1) Before desired time
(2) After desired time
.VARI TABLE
profile in radiosonde tablular
(rstab) format, suitable for
MODIN, TIMSCAL2, etc
.VARI TIME
Desired time, measured as GMT
in hours and fraction of hours.
.VARI LAT
Latitude (North positive)
.VARI LONG
Longitude (East positive)
.VARI DATE
Date to be added to table header
.VARI ELEV
Desired surface elevation,
in meters
.VARI MODEL
MODTRAN model to span to top
of atmosphere. Used only if a
file is output.
Valid: MLS,MLW,SAS,SAW,TROP,USS
.VARI PRINTALL
Print all 8 source profiles?
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
      The variable INP specifies the names of the two NCEP global data files
to be used in the interpolation.  The first file should be for the snapshot
immediately preceeding the desired time, and the second file should be for
the snapshot immediately after the desired time.  The input files should be
VICAR labelled, and in the JPL abridged format.  This format is halfword data
in BSQ format, 181 lines by 360 samples.  The number of channels varies with
the date of assimilation.  The upper left corner is 90 degrees North, 0 
degrees East/West.  The attributes assigned to each channel are described on
the following pages.

.VARI TABLE
      If the parameter TABLE is used, a table in the format appropriate for
use as input for or TIMSCAL2 (parameter RSTABLE in TIMSCAL2) is generated,
and stored with this file name.
.VARI TIME
      The variable TIME specifies the time (in hours and fraction of hours
past midnight) for the desired interpolation.  The time should be expressed
as GMT/UT, not as local time.
.VARI LAT
      The variable LAT specifies the latitude (in degrees and fraction of
degrees North) for the desired interpolation. The range of valid values is
from -90.0 (South Pole) to +90.0 (North Pole).
.VARI LONG
      The variable LONG specifies the longitude (in degrees and fraction of
degrees East longitude) for the desired interpolation.  Note that all 
locations in the Western Hemisphere have negative values.  The valid range
of values is +/- 180.0
.VARI DATE
This optional parameter allows the user to supply a date to be placed in the
output profile's header text.  It is not used in the computation of the profile,
and it is the responsibility of the user to assure that the date given is
consistent with the input files.
.VARI ELEV
This optional parameter allows the user to specify the desired surface 
elevation, in meters.  This elevation will be used to compute the first
layer in the interpolated profile. If ELEV is defaulted, then the elevation
of the first layer will be the computed interpolated elevation that 
corresponds to the 1000 millibar level.
.VARI MODEL
      If a tablar output file is generated, relative humidities for
the upper layers and a top of atmosphere layer must be supplied from another
source.  This parameter allows the user to specify any of the 6 MODTRAN model
atmospheres to complete the profiles. The meanings of the valid keywords are
as follows:

           MLS  - Midlatitude Summer
           MLW  - Midlatitude Winter
           SAS  - Subarctic Summer
           SAW  - Subarctic Winter
           TROP - Tropical
           USS  - 1976 United States Standard Atmosphere
.VARI PRINTALL
      If this keyword is invoked, the 8 original profiles that are used to
compose the interpolated profile are also printed.
