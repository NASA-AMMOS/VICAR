      GAINOFF is a program to apply differing gains and offsets to the various
channels of multispectral data.  It accepts as input images of BSQ or BIL 
format, and data types BYTE, HALF, FULL, or REAL.  Regardless of input format,
the output will be in BIL format.
      The gains and offsets for each channel are supplied through a second 
input dataset, which is an ASCII (non-VICAR) file.  This ASCII file should be a
table of numbers at least 3 columns wide, and have one row of numbers for each
band to be processed. The gain values are taken from column 2 and the offset
values are taken from column 3.  All other columns and any headers or annotation
in the file is ignored. Row 1 of the file provides the gain and offset for the
first band processed, Row 2 provides for the second band and so on.
      In addition, the parameters INGAIN and OUTGAIN may be used to adjust the 
values of all pixels, regardless of band.  INGAIN is multiplied to all input
pixels prior to the spectral gain, and may be used to compensate for mismatched
units.  OUTGAIN is multiplied to all pixels just prior to output, and may be
used to rescale the data over the desired output range.
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input image, gain/offset file
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image file name
.VARIABLE SIZE
Window into input
.VARIABLE BANDS
Window into input
in band dimension
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
= size(1)
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
= size(2)
.VARIABLE SB
Starting band
= bands(1)
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
= size(3)
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
= size(4)
.VARIABLE NB
Number of bands
= bands(2)
.VARIABLE INGAIN
Gain applied prior to
spectral gains/offsets
.VARIABLE OUTGAIN
Gain applied after
spectral gains/offsets
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The first file is the image file, in VICAR format. It may be either in BSQ or
BIL organization, and BYTE, HALF, FULL, or REAL format.

The second file must be an ASCII file of three columns of numbers. The second
column will be used as the spectral gain, and the third column used as the
spectral offset. The first column is ignored. The ASCII file may contain headers
and annotation, and must have the same number of rows of numbers as the number
of bands to be processed.
.VARIABLE OUT
Name of the output image file. The output file will be in BIL format, 
regardless of the format of the input image.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the computation is to take place.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.VARIABLE BANDS
The bands parameter determines the bands in the input
file from which the computation is to take place.  It is specified
as (SB,NB), where
	SB is the starting band
	NB is the number of bands to be copied
.VARIABLE INGAIN
INGAIN is a value multiplied to all input pixels prior to the application of
individual gains.  It may be used to get the units of the image to match the
units of the gains.
.VARIABLE OUTGAIN
OUTGAIN is a value multiplied to all pixels immediately prior to output. It
may be used to rescale the data into a reasonable range for byte or halfword 
output.
