TAE PROCESS MASTERTOA
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   MASTERTOA is a program that accepts as input MASTER TIR radiance at sensor 
image data and outputs expected upwelling radiance at the top of atmosphere
for the thermal infrared channels (Channels 41-50).  Also required as input 
are a valid MODTRAN input file, to define the atmospheric model, and a MASTER 
TIR spectral response file.


OPERATION:

   MASTERTOA takes as input the 10 Channels of MASTER TIR radiance at sensor
data in units of Watts per square meter per steradian per micrometer, and a
file containing the the MASTER TIR spectral response functions. This second
file must be a VICAR labelled file consisting of ten lines (one for each TIR
channel) and 900 samples (one for the spectral response at each wavenumber
from 601 to 1500). The spectral response functions must be normalized, i.e.,
the sum of all values on each line must be 1.0.
   The atmospheric model used is defined by a user supplied MODTRAN input
file.  MASTERTOA uses these parameters to run MODTRAN three times; once with a
nadir looking geometry, once for the case of viewing at maximum deflection
from nadir, and once with the observer at the top of atmosphere, nadir viewing.
From these three runs, the atmospheric transmittance and path radiance are 
calculated for the ten MASTER TIR bandpasses, for paths from the surface to 
the MASTER altitude, at all viewing angles. Also calculated are the path
radiance and the transmittance from the surface to the top of atmosphere,
nadir looking.  The downwelling sky radiance values are placed in the VICAR 
label of the output dataset.
   Values of transmittance and path radiance are calculated for each pixel
location in the scene by interpolation, where it is assumed that each
quantity varies linearly with path length.
   The upwelling radiance at surface is then computed by the following 
formulas:

	Rad(at surface) = (Rad(at sensor)-Rad(path)) / transmittance
        Rad(at top of atmosphere) = RAD(at surface)*transmittance + Rad(path)

        (In the formulas above, transmittance and Rad(path) refer to
         the surface to MASTER path in the first formula, and surface
         to top of atmosphere in the second formula.)

   The output dataset consists of 10 channels of real (32 bit floating
point) pixels, in units of Watts per square meter per steradian per
micrometer.  Note that these units differ from the units that this program
output prior to November, 2004. The downwelling sky irradiance values that
are placed in the VICAR label are in units of milliWatts per square meter per
micrometer.  To convert to radiance in units consistent with the output images,
one must divide by 1000.0*pi.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
(1) MASTER TIR radiance at
    sensor image
(2) MASTER TIR spectral
    response file
.VARI OUT
Output data set of the 10 MASTER
TIR bands, for upwelling
radiance at surface.
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR2 output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample (not used)
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples (not used)
.VARI MODINP
Dataset name for the MODTRAN
input file, containing the
atmospheric data relevant to
this image.
.VARI MODOUT
Dataset name for MODTRAN
output report file.
.VARI MODTAB
Dataset name for MODTRAN
output tabular file.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The first file should contain the 10 channels of MASTER TIR image data,
calibrated as radiance at sensor, in units of Watts per square meter per
steradian per micrometer.

The second file should be the MASTER TIR spectra response calibration file 
(in VICAR format) that is in effect for the date of data acquisition.
These files are typically located in the directory 

          $V2TOP/luts

and have names of the form

         resp.master.tir.YEAR.MON

.VARI OUT
The output dataset will contain upwelling radiance at surface data for the
ten MASTER TIR channels (Channels 41 to 50), in units of Watts per suqare meter
per steradian per micrometer.  Output pixels are real (32 bit floating point).
The units of the downwelling sky irradiance (values placed in the VICAR label
of the output) are milliWatts per square meter per micrometer (no steradian
term).
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,716)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI MODINP
   The atmospheric and geometric parameters needed by this program to run
   MODTRAN are supplied by the user providing a valid MODTRAN input (TAPE5)
   file.  This file may be generated by the stand alone program "modin",
   or by any other means convenient to the user.
.VARI MODOUT
   As a default, the report file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODOUT, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset.  If a dataset name is not given
   as a parameter, but one is supplied in the MODTRAN input file, then the
   report file is saved under that name.
.VARI MODTAB
   As a default, the tabular file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODTAB, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset.  If a dataset name is not given
   as a parameter, but one is supplied in the MODTRAN input file, then the
   tabular file is saved under that name.
