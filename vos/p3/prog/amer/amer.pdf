.TITLE
AMER version 21-Jan-96 
.HELP
AMER performs the Average MMD Emissivity Residuals transformation on an 
input dataset. MMD is the Min-Max Difference. 
The input dataset must be in units of radiance as output by TIMSCAL2 
in order for this program to work correctly. These are mW/m*m/um/sr.

The output has one more band than the input. This extra band contains
the alpha temperature, the other bands contain the alpha emissivity.

The empirical calibration curve used to obtain the amer mean is
-0.790683 * mmd^0.723098
where MMD is the min-max difference of the alpha residual an ^ raises
to the power

Testing
This program was tested on an artificial 2x2x6 band radiance dataset. 

RESTRICTIONS;
1. Input data must be in halfword. This is a simple check since its
unlikely the input is not in radiance units if its in byte.
2. Maximum size of one band of the input is 10,000 values.
3. Maximum number of bands in the input is 20.

HISTORY
Written by Simon J. Hook in FORTRAN.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input radiance dataset 
(Halfword) in radiance 
(mW/m*m/um/sr)
.VARIABLE OUT
Output AMER emissivity dataset 
plus an extra band including the
AMER temperature. 
All output data in Halfword. 
AMER emissivity data in 
emissivity*1.0e4. Temperature 
in degrees*100.
.VARIABLE SIZE
standard VICAR size field
.VARIABLE SL
starting line
.VARIABLE SS
starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
number of samples
.VARIABLE WAVE
the central wavelength for the 
input channels, in micrometers.
(1 value per channel)
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE WAVE
The centroid wavelength value for each channel in micrometers. This can be 
calculated for a TIMS image using TIMSRESP (The central wavelength values are
dumped to the screen after the program runs).
