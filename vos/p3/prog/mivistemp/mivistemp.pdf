TAE PROCESS MIVISTEMP
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   MIVISTEMP is a program that accepts as input the ten MIVIS TIR channels
of radiance (Channels 93-102), and calculates the corresponding kinetic 
temperatures for each channel at each pixel.


OPERATION:

   MIVISTEMP requires as input a 10 channel MIVIS TIR image dataset of
radiance and the radiance-to-temperature lookup table appropriate for the
image dataset.  The program accepts as parameter input the spectral emissivity
for each channel.  If the spectral emissivity for a channel is not 1.0, then
the downwelling irradiance for each channel is read from the VICAR label and 
radiance is adjusted via the following formula:

      Rad(emitted) = Rad(upwelling) - (1-emissivity)*Irrad(downwelling)/pi

The emitted radiance is converted to the corresponding blackbody radiance
by dividing by the spectral emissivity, and the supplied lookup table is
used to convert the blackbody radiance to kinetic temperature.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
(1) MIVIS TIR radiance image
(2) MIVIS TIR temperature
    lookup table
.VARI OUT
Output dataset of the 10 MIVIS
TIR bands, for kinetic
temperature
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR2 output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI EMIS
Spectral emissivity for each
MIVIS channel.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The first file should contain the 10 TIR channels of MIVIS image data,
calibrated in units of milliWatts per square meter per steradian per 
micrometer.

The second file should be the MIVIS TIR radiance to temperature lookup 
table for the spectral response calibration that is in effect for the date
of data acquisition.
.VARI OUT
The output dataset will contain surface kinetic temperature for each of the
10 input channels, assuming the emissivities supplied in the EMIS parameter.
Output pixels are halfword (16 bit signed integer), in units of degrees
Celsius, scaled by a factor of 100.0

For example,

       DN = 2531  denotes a temperature of 25.31 degrees Celsius.
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,755)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI EMIS
These are the spectral emissivity values assumed when computing the amount
of reflected downwelling radiance in the input, and when using the Planck
function to convert from radiance to temperature.  Ten values are required,
one for each MASTER channel from Channel 93 to 102.
