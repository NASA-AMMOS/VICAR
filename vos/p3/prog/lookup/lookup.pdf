LOOKUP
.HELP
 PURPOSE:

LOOKUP generates output images from input images using data number
mappings defined in a multi-channel lookup table.  The user can specify 
the table by giving its location (if it is contained in a file), by 
entering the contents of the table as program parameters, or by naming an 
IDX pseudocolor transformation. The user has the option of modifying the 
table via the CHANGE and LTABLE parameters. The modified table may then be 
saved by specifying the SAVE or TBLSAVE parameter.
.PAGE
 EXECUTION:

In the table format used by LOOKUP, a lookup table is made up of four
independent channels.  Each channel defines a mapping or discrete
transfer function to be applied to an input image. Some of these
channels may be undefined depending on the application.  The lookup
table is limited to four channels because LOOKUP allows at most
four output images.  LOOKUP allows at most four input images.

In the most straightforward use of LOOKUP, the number of input images
is equal to the number of output images and the default channel
assignments are used.  In this case, the first channel in the table
is used to map the first input image to the first output image, the
second channel in the table is used to map the second input image to 
the second output image, and so on.
.PAGE
The user may select to use different channels (than the default) with
the images by using the USE parameter.  The user may also specify
fewer input images than output images.  In this case, the last input
image is mapped through the remaining channels to create the appropriate
number of output images.  Thus, one input image could be mapped through
three independent channels (transfer functions) to three output images.
This feature allows simple production of Pseudo Color pictures.
.PAGE
When the user specifies a lookup table in a file, LOOKUP requires that
the file have a particular format.  The file must contain a VICAR label
followed by one or more tables, each table being stored as one 1024-byte
record.  A table record contains 1024 output data number values in the
following order:

 d(0,1), d(0,2), d(0,3), d(0,4),... d(255,1), d(255,2), d(255,3), d(255,4),

where d(i,j) is the output data number to which the data number i is mapped
by channel j.  The user specifies the location of the table by giving the
name of the file and the number (ordinal) of the table within the file.  
In general, such a file is built using another VICAR program or using
LOOKUP itself.
.PAGE
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:
      LOOKUP INP=(a...) OUT=(b...) SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      LOOKUP INP=(a...) OUT=(b...) SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns optional parameters
      LOOKUP (a...) (b...) (sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      LOOKUP (a...) (b...) optional parameters

       Here (a...) represents a list of one to five file names which includes
       from one to four input image file names optionally followed by the
       name of a file containing the lookup table to be used by this program.
       (b...) represents a list of one to four output image file names
       optionally followed by an output lookup table file.

      LOOKUP also accepts command lines without the INP or OUT fields.  
      This allows the user to use LOOKUP just for working with tables.
.PAGE
EXAMPLES

1.    LOOKUP  INP=(L1 T1) OUT=L2 'LIST TABNO=2 USE=3

      In this example, channel 3 of table 2 of file T1 is used to map
      image file L1 to image file L2.

2.    LOOKUP IN (RED,GREEN,BLUE) PS=3

      In this example, the IDX pseudocolor transformation PS 3 is used to
      map image file IN to files RED, GREEN, and BLUE. The color assignments
      must be in this order to get results corresponding to what is seen in
      IDX.
.PAGE
3.    LOOKUP INP=(L1) OUT=(L3,L4,L5,T2) 'NEWTBLF        +
             LTABLE=( 0       0  1  2                   +
                      1  -98  2  3  4                   +
                      99 -255 5  6  7                     )

      In this example, the three channels of the table defined through the
      LTABLE parameter are used to map the input file to the three output
      files.  T2 is the output table file, in which the table is saved.

RESTRICTIONS
1. The input and output images and the table file must be byte data.
2. Maximum number of samples is 20000 per line.

lookup table saved in the next 
available location in an
existing table file.
.VARIABLE TBLSAVE
To have the lookup table saved
in an exactly specified
location in an existing table 
file, enter the table number
(location).
.VARIABLE USE
Specifies which channel of the
table corresponds to which
output image. The nth value
entered is the channel for
the nth output image.
.VARIABLE CHANGE
One or more of the following
type of changes can be entered
using the following format:
CHANGE=(n1,m1 n2,m2 ...)
The table entries for data
number ni are, for each channel,
replaced with the table entries
for data number mi, for
i=1,2,...
.VARIABLE NCHAN 
The number of channels for which
data is entered under the LTABLE
parameter.  The default for
NCHAN is the number of output
images.
.VARIABLE LTABLE
Specifies values for the lookup
table.  If a table from a file
is not used, then the table
must be defined through LTABLE
values.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
If an input table file is specified, it must be the last input file listed,
and the TABNO, TBLSAVE, or SAVE parameter must be specified.
.VARIABLE OUT
If an output table file is specified, it must be the last output file listed,
and the NEWTBLF, TBLSAVE, or SAVE parameter must be specified.
.VARIABLE LIST
The default LIST value is no listing of the lookup table.
.VARIABLE TABNO
The basis for the lookup table will be the table number (record number)
specified by this parameter. If this parameter is used, a lookup table
dataset must be supplied as the last input dataset.
.VARIABLE PS
The basis for the lookup table will be the IDX pseudocolor table of the same
number. IT may then be modified via the LTABLE parameter. Valid tables are:
      PS=0      for an identity transformation (all outputs like input)
         1      for the original 8 color table
         2      for the original 16 color table
         3      for the original 32 color table
         4      for the 16 color table, with colors selected for screen display
         5      for the 8 color table, with colors selected for screen display
         6      for the 6 color table
         7      for the 4 color table
         8      for the 32 color table, with colors selected for MDA playback
         9      for the 16 color table, with colors selected for MDA playback
        10      for the 10 color table, with colors selected for MDA playback
        11      for the 8 color table, with colors selected for MDA playback
PS3 and PS8 use black and white as two of the 32 colors; PS10 and PS11 use
black and white in addition to the stated number of colors to denote saturation.
They map only 0 and 255 input. All other tables do not use black or white.
.VARIABLE NEWTBLF
If you wish to save (write out) the lookup table and the 
table file is new, enter 'NEWTBLF. The lookup table will be saved as table 1.
 If NEWTBLF is specified, then neither SAVE nor TBLSAVE is specified.
.VARIABLE SAVE
If you wish to save (write out) the lookup table in an existing table
file, enter either 'SAVE to have the lookup table saved in the next 
available location in the table file,      or
enter a specific location (table number) for TBLSAVE.
The modified table file will be written to the output table file specified
in the OUT parameter.  The input table file is not modified.
.VARIABLE TBLSAVE
If you wish to save (write out) the lookup table in an existing table
file, enter either 'SAVE to have the lookup table saved in the next 
available location in the table file,      or
enter a specific location (table number) for TBLSAVE.
The modified table file will be written to the output table file specified
in the OUT parameter.  The input table file is not modified.
.VARIABLE USE
The default is USE=(1,2,3,4).
.VARIABLE CHANGE
Pairs of values are entered following the CHANGE keyword.  Each pair
of values represents a change to the lookup mapping.  Although the
program accomplishes the change by changing the table, the effect on
the lookup mapping can best be explained as changing input data numbers
of the first value (in the pair) to the second value (of the pair)
before the lookup table is applied.  Each change is based
on the table specified and is independent of other changes
specified with it.
The CHANGE parameters may be used with or without LTABLE parameters.
If both LTABLE and CHANGE parameters are used, the CHANGE parameters
are applied to the result produced by the LTABLE parameters.
.VARIABLE LTABLE
By specifying LTABLE parameters the user can apply modifications to
an existing table or can completely define a new table.  These
parameters specify the data numbers for each channel to which
given data numbers are to be mapped.

LTABLE parameters are entered in groups of NCHAN+1 values
for a single data number or NCHAN+2 values for a range of
data numbers. For a single data number, the group consists
of the data number followed by the values assigned to that
data number for each of the NCHAN channels.  For a range of
data numbers, the group consists of the data number for the
start of the range followed by  -1 times the data number 
for the end of the range followed by the values assigned to
any data number in that range for each of the NCHAN channels.

When modifying an existing table, the user enters groups of 
parameters only for the data numbers for which changes are
desired.  When defining a new table, the user enters the full
table so that a mapping is defined for all of the data numbers
from 0 to 255.

The following example illustrates the format and usage of the LTABLE
parameters.  In this example the mapping is completely defined for
two channels.  The first channel maps  0 to 1, 1 to 3, and 2 through
255 to 5.  The second channel maps  0 to 2, 1 to 4, and 2 through
255 to 6.
          LTABLE = ( 0         1  2           +
                     1         3  4           +
                     2  -255   5  6             )

The LTABLE parameters may be used with or without CHANGE parameters.
If both LTABLE and CHANGE parameters are used, the CHANGE parameters
are applied to the result produced by the LTABLE parameters.
