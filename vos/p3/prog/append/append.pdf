VICAR Program APPEND
.HELP
PURPOSE:
APPEND accepts up to ten data sets and writes them out, one after
another, as a single data set.  All 3-D organizations are handled
in the logically correct manner.

EXECUTION:

Example
	APPEND INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D    will write A, B, and C out to D.

Size and parameter fields are not used.

Note:  APPEND outputs the total number of lines and samples written;
if input images are of varying data types, the "number of samples written"
will be the number of samples of the smallest data type. If real input 
is mixed with integer, the data type of the output will be integer.
.PAGE
OPERATION:
After opening all the inputs, APPEND computes the size of the output 
data set. Each input is then copied into the output data set, in the 
same order as specified in the command.  If the inputs are of varying 
sample length, the output lines are padded with zeroes on the end.  
All output lines are of the same length, the length of the longest 
input line.

Currently BYTE, HALF, FULL, and REAL formats are supported.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input image files
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output image file
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the input data sets.  Up to ten are allowed.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT specifies the output data set.  The number of lines in the output will 
be the sum of the number of lines in all the inputs.  The number of samples 
will be the maximum of the number of samples of all the inputs.
