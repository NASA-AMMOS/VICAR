 REPAIR --  Find and replace bad lines (or line segments) in images
.HELP
      REPAIR identifies bad lines (lines that are inconsistent with the
surrounding lines) and replaces them by interpolation of the nearest good 
lines. If the locations of the bad lines or line segments are known, the user 
may list the offending lines and use the ALL mode to repair just those lines.
If the locations of the bad lines are unknown, the program decides which lines
are bad by computing the interline correlation (and optionally the differences
in the means and the variances).
      REPAIR can now repair multichannel data in BSQ or BIL organizations. All
channels are tested in aggregate, and if the line is found to be bad, the line
is replaced in all channels. No specific channel repairs are presently 
implemented.
.PAGE
 OPERATION
      There are three modes of operation to REPAIR. The CORR and MV modes 
differ only in the tests employed to determine bad lines, but the ALL mode 
does no statistical testing, and is more closely related to the earlier VICAR 
program SAR. 
      In the ALL mode, lines or regions are specified by the user via the AREA,
LINESET, BADLINE, and/or MODULO parameters. These regions are replaced by means
of a linear interpolation, using the lines immediately above and below the 
region. Interpolation is performed in the line direction only, and the area 
outside the specified regions is unchanged.
      In the CORR and MV modes, the AREA, LINESET, BADLINE and MODULO 
parameters are used to identify regions to be examined for bad lines. If all 
three parameters are defaulted, the entire image is tested. Each line that is 
to be checked is tested by the following procedure:
.PAGE
      A. The line is compared to two reference lines: the last good line, and 
         the average of the next line and the last good line.
      B. If the correlation coefficients between the test line and both of the
         reference lines is less than the value of CORR, then the line is 
         considered bad. There is one exception to this test. If the ZOK (Zero
         OK) keyword is in effect, lines that are all zeroes are passed as
         good. The correlation coefficient is undefined for lines of constant 
         value, requiring this special case. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 
         is assigned to all other cases involving lines of constant DN.
      C. If the MV (Mean and Variance) mode is in effect, then two additional 
         tests are employed. The test line is considered bad if its mean is 
         different than the means of the reference lines by more than the value 
         of MEAN, or if its variance is different than both the reference line 
         variances by more than the value of VARIANCE.
 If a line is found to be bad, the entire line is replaced by a linear
 interpolation of the last good line and the next good line. 
.PAGE
      This algorithm is fairly sensitive to the values of the CORR, MEAN, and
 VARIANCE parameters. It may be necessary to run this program more than once
 in order to find an appropriate set of values. In general, the CORR and 
 VARIANCE values provide the best tests for random noise and hashed lines. The
 test of the means should only rarely be needed to reject a line.
      The coordinates used in the AREA parameter (SL,SS,NL,NS,...) refer to the
 input image, not the output image. This is important only if, in the size
 field, the starting line or starting sample is not one. 
      The user should also be aware that if two regions specified by AREA, 
 LINESET, or BADLINE contain the same line, the two regions will be combined 
 into one larger region that contains both original regions. This can cause
 problems, especially in the ALL mode, where more pixels may be modified than
 were intended.
      This program will run on byte, halfword, fullword, or real data. Up to
 100 regions may by given by each of the AREA, LINESET, and BADLINE parameters.
 If either MEAN or VARIANCE is not defaulted, the MV mode is automatically
 used.

.VARIABLE MODE
      The program REPAIR operates in three different modes: CORR (the default),
 MV, and ALL. 
      If ALL is specified, no statistical checking is performed, and all 
 regions specified by the AREA, LINESET, BADLINE and MODULO parameters are 
 replaced by interpolating the nearest two lines.
      In the CORRelation mode, a line is considered to be a good line if the
 correlation coefficient between it and the last good line is greater than the
 threshold value specified by CORR. The line is also considered good if its
 correlation with the average of the last good line and the next line is above
 the threshold.
      If MV is specified, two tests are made, in addition to the correlation
 test. The difference in means must be less than the value specified by MEAN,
 and the difference in variances must be less than the value specified by
 VARIANCE. If a line passes all three tests, it is considered good.
.VARIABLE AREA
      The AREA, LINESET, BADLINE and MODULO parameters are used to limit the 
 portion of the image in which lines may be replaced. BADLINE is used to 
 identify individual lines to be checked. LINESET is used to specify sets of 
 lines, in the format (SL1,NL1,SL2,NL2,...), when the general region of concern
 is known, but not the exact location. The MODULO parameter is used to test
 and/or replace bad lines that may occur in a periodic fashion.  For example,
 MODULO=(4,20) could be used to test/replace every 20th line, starting with
 Line 4. Unlike the other parameters, MODULO acts as an additional restriction.
 If more than one of AREA, LINESET, and BADLINE are specified, then a line
 is tested/replaced if it satisfies any of the parameters, but if MODULO and
 another parameter is specified, then the line must meet both criteria to be
 tested/replaced. The AREA parameter allows the user to select a portion of 
 the lines to be examined. The values for AREA must be specified in sets of 
 four, (SL1,SS1,NL1,NS1,SL2,SS2,NL2,NS2,...). 
      If the MODE is ALL, then all pixels in the regions specified are replaced 
 by interpolation of the adjacent two lines. 
      If MODE is CORR or MV, these values describe the region from which 
 statistics are gathered. If a line is found to be  bad, the entire line is 
 replaced. 
      AREA, LINESET, and BADLINE accept up to 100 regions, and all three may
 be used in the same task. However, if two of the regions contain a common
 line, then the regions are combined (and perhaps enlarged) into the 
 rectangular region that contains both of them.
.VARIABLE LINESET
      The AREA, LINESET, BADLINE and MODULO parameters are used to limit the 
 portion of the image in which lines may be replaced. BADLINE is used to 
 identify individual lines to be checked. LINESET is used to specify sets of 
 lines, in the format (SL1,NL1,SL2,NL2,...), when the general region of concern
 is known, but not the exact location. The MODULO parameter is used to test
 and/or replace bad lines that may occur in a periodic fashion.  For example,

 the lines to be examined. The values for AREA must be specified in sets of 
 four, (SL1,SS1,NL1,NS1,SL2,SS2,NL2,NS2,...).

 by interpolation of the adjacent two lines. 
      If MODE is CORR or MV, these values describe the region from which 
 statistics are gathered. If a line is found to be  bad, the entire line is 
 replaced.

.VARIABLE BADLINE
      The AREA, LINESET, BADLINE and MODULO parameters are used to limit the 
 portion of the image in which lines may be replaced. BADLINE is used to 
 identify individual lines to be checked. LINESET is used to specify sets of

 be used in the same task. However, if two of the regions contain a common
 line, then the regions are combined (and perhaps enlarged) into the 
 rectangular region that contains both of them.
.VARIABLE CORR
      The parameter CORR sets the minimum value of the correlation coefficient
 between lines for a line to be considered good. Correlation coefficients may
 range from 1.0 (two lines that match perfectly) to -1.0 (one line perfectly
 matches the complement of the other).
.VARIABLE MEAN
       The value of MEAN is the maximum allowed difference between the means
 of two lines for a line to be considered good.
.VARIABLE VARIANCE
       The value of VARIANCE is the maximum allowed difference between the 
 variances of two lines for a line to be considered good. The variance is the
 square of the standard deviation.
.VARIABLE ZOK
       The keyword ZOK is used when lines that are entirely 0 DN may be
present in the picture, and the user does not want them replaced.
