TES (last modified 2004-11-05)
.HELP
TES uses the TES algorithm to calculate the emissivity and temperature
from an input dataset. The input dataset must be in radiance units of
Watts per square meter per steradian per micrometer.  This is different
from versions of the program in effect prior to November, 2004.  As a
consequence, input pixels should be real (floating point) values.

The output has one more band than the input. This extra band contains
the tes temperature (the last band), the other bands contain the tes 
emissivity.

Testing
This program was tested on an artificial 2x2x6 band radiance dataset. 

RESTRICTIONS;
1. Maximum size of one band of the input is 10,000 values.
2. Maximum number of bands in the input is 20.
3. If the input radiance is LE zero (mW/m*m/um/sr) the pixel is considered bad
   and not processed. Bad pixel emissivities are set to -1 and -2 respectively.
4. If the emissivity calculated from the regression is LE zero or GE 1.0, the
   pixel is considered bad and set to -3 and -4 respectively. 

HISTORY
Written by Simon J. Hook in FORTRAN.
27 Oct 2004  ...rea...     Modified to accept FULLWORD and REAL input pixels,
                           and remove the restriction of 20,000 for maximum
                           input pixel value.
                           HOT keyword added.
 5 Nov 2004  ...rea...     Modified to treat both input and output pixels as
                           unscaled values.  Output pixels are now real (rather
                           than scaled integer) values.
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input radiance dataset in
radiance (W/m*m/um/sr)
.VARIABLE OUT
Output tes emissivity dataset 
plus an extra band including the
tes temperature. 
Emissivity range: 0.0 to 1.0
Temperature in degrees Celsius
.VARIABLE SIZE
standard VICAR size field
.VARIABLE SL
starting line
.VARIABLE SS

.VARIABLE EMIS
the assumed emissivity for the

.VARIABLE WAVE

input channels, in micrometers.
(1 value per channel)
.VARIABLE SKYRAD

values in mW/m**2/um/sr as 
output by TIMSCAL2
(1 value per channel)
.VARIABLE NITER

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE WAVE
The centroid wavelength value for each channel in micrometers. This can be 
calculated for a TIMS image using TIMSRESP (The central wavelength values are
dumped to the screen after the program runs).

.VARIABLE TES
TES uses an empirical calibration curve to calculate the emissivity minimum 
from the temperature independant MMD ratio. This calibration curve was derived 
by convolving ASTER library spectra to the ASTER or MASTER channels and 
plotting the MMD against the emissivity minimum. The empirical formula has the 
form:

a-b*MMD^c

where the coefficients (a, b and c) are determined for either ASTER or MASTER. 
In the caseof MASTER they are provided for the case where you have all 10 
MASTER thermal channels and also the case where you have the inner 8 MASTER 
channels. This latter case is provided since the shortest and longest 
wavelength MASTER channels are strongly influenced by the atmosphere and often 
a better result is obtained by excluding these channels from TES since they 
typically contain residual atmospheric effects which will negatively influence 
the result.

ASTER 6 band
a = 0.994
b = 0.687
c = 0.737 

MASTER 10 band
a = 1.001
b = 0.761
c = 0.812

MASTER 8 band
a = 0.990
b = 0.757
c = 0.834

where MMD is the maximum difference of the beta ratio and ^ = raise to power.
