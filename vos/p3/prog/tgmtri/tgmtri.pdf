VICAR Program TGMTRI
.HELP
PURPOSE
     TGMTRI accepts as input the triangles file that is output by TRIGRID, and
produces an image of those triangles.  That is, the output file is an image
dataset of the size of the rectified image. The value of each pixel (halfword)
is the number of the triangle to be used to generatate that pixel during
rectification.
     For example, assume that Line 50, Sample 30 in the output image has the 
value 200.  This means that triangle 200 is to be used to compute the input
pixel location that maps to Line 50, Sample 30.  The coefficients for this
transformation will be in Record (Line) 200 of the input file.  In the output
image from TGMTRI, the pixels with the value 200 will form a triangular
region that includes Line 50, Sample 30.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input triangles dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
Output triangle image dataset
.VARIABLE SL
Line number of first output line
.VARIABLE SS
Sample number of first output sample
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines in output image
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samps in output image
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input dataset must be a triangles dataset, normally the output dataset
from the program TRIGRID.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output dataset will be a halfword image dataset. The value at each pixel
corresponds to the record (line) number in the input file that would be used
to compute the old pixel location that maps to this point.
.VARIABLE NL
NL is the number of lines in the output image.  It should be the number of
lines in the rectified image that will be created by TGEOM2.
.VARIABLE NS
NS is the number of samples in the output image.  It should be the number of
samples in the rectified image that will be created by TGEOM2.
