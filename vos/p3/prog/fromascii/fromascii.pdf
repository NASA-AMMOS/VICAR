.help
      FROMASCII is a VICAR program to convert part or all of a tabular (ASCII)
file into a VICAR image.  The user may provide a FORTRAN format specifier, or
the data may be read as free format.  In either case, lines that do not fit
the form (such as headers, page counts, and trailers) are ignored.  The user 
may select and interchange up to 150 columns for output.
.level1
.vari ASCII
Input ASCII file name
.vari OUT
Output VICAR file name
.vari NCOL
Number of columns in input
.vari SLINE
First Line to be converted
.vari NLINES
Number of lines to be output
.vari COLUMNS
Columns (sample positions)
to be output.
DEFAULT: Output all columns
.VARI FORMAT
Input print format
.VARI DATA
Output data type
Valid: BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL
.level2
.vari ASCII
Name of the tabular ASCII input file.
.vari out
Name of the VICAR output file.
.vari ncol
NCOL is used to indicate the number of columns in the input file.  If the user
provides a format for reading the input, this is the number of columns actually
read by the input format.  Any columns skipped, by use of the X format 
descriptor, are not counted.
.vari SLINE
SLINE indicates the first line to be converted into the output VICAR
file. For example, if SLINE=10, then the first 9 lines are discarded. 
The count of this parameter is of all lines; both valid data lines and
invalid lines (such as titles or lines of headings) are included in the
count.  The default is to start with the first line.
.vari NUM_LINES
NLINES indicates the desired number of lines to be output. Once this
number of lines has been written to output, no further reading of the 
input, or conversion to output is performed.  If the end of the output 
file is reached before NUM_LINES are converted, the program reports
and stores in the VICAR label the actual number of lines in the output
file.  The default is to read and convert all lines, until the end-of-file
is reached.
.vari columns
COLUMNS is a parameter that allows the user to select and order the columns to
be used as input.  For example, COLUMNS=(3,7,2,4) will cause the output to be
four samples wide, with the first sample coming from Column 3, the second from
Column 7, the third from Column 2, and the fourth from Column 4.  If COLUMNS is
defaulted, all columns are selected and output in their original order.
.vari format
The user may override the default print format by supplying a valid FORTRAN
FORMAT statement as the value of this parameter.  For example,
FORMAT="(14X,F5.1,6X,F5.1)" would, in the following example,  read the "Temp"
and "Wet Bulb" columns only.  The two header lines, since they do not fit the
given format, are discarded.  All other columns are ignored.

                  Weatherstation:  Tonopah, Nevada
      Time     Temp     Wet Bulb   Wind   Dir   Pressure
      8:00     57.5       33.2      9     NE     30.02
      9:00     59.8       33.7      5     NNE    30.02
     10:00     62.9       33.9      5     NE     30.01
     11:00     66.1       34.3      1     NE     29.99

Note that parentheses enclosing the full format expression are required, with
quotes enclosing the parentheses, and that the specifiers must be in agreement
with the DATA parameter.  If FORMAT is defaulted, the program assumes that
there are NCOL columns, separated by blanks, tabs, or commas.
.vari data
DATA is used to specify the data type of the output VICAR image.  BYTE, HALF,
FULL, and REAL are valid, with REAL being the default.
