TAE PROCESS ASTERTEMP
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   ASTERTEMP is a program that accepts as input the five ASTER TIR channels
of radiance (Channels 10-14), and calculates the corresponding kinetic 
temperatures for each channel at each pixel.


OPERATION:

   ASTERTEMP requires as input a 5 channel ASTER TIR image dataset of
radiance and the radiance-to-temperature lookup table.  The program accepts
as parameter input the spectral emissivity and the downwelling sky irradiance
for each channel.  First, the input radiance is adjusted via the following 
formula:

      Rad(emitted) = Rad(upwelling) - (1-emissivity)*Irrad(downwelling)/pi

The emitted radiance is converted to the corresponding blackbody radiance
by dividing by the spectral emissivity, and the supplied lookup table is
used to convert the blackbody radiance to kinetic temperature.  In the
default mode, linear interpolation is used between lookup table entries.
If the keyword NO is supplied, no interpolation is performed, and the 
closest table entry is used.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
(1) ASTER TIR radiance image
(2) ASTER TIR temperature
    lookup table
.VARI OUT
Output dataset of the 5 ASTER
TIR bands, for kinetic
temperature
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR2 output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI SKYRAD
Sky irradiance for each
ASTER channel.
.VARI EMIS
Spectral emissivity for each
ASTER channel.
.VARI INTERP
Iterpolate lookup table values?
Valid: YES, NO
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The first file should contain the 5 TIR channels of ASTER image data,
calibrated in units of milliWatts per square meter per steradian per 
micrometer.

The second file should be the ASTER TIR radiance to temperature lookup 
table.  The default file contains the standard calibration lookup table.

.VARI OUT
The output dataset will contain surface kinetic temperature for each of the
5 input channels, assuming the emissivities supplied in the EMIS parameter,
and the sky irradiances supplied in the SKYRAD parameter.  Note, however,
that if the emissivity is 1.0, the value of the sky irradiance is 
irrelevant.

Output pixels are halfword (16 bit signed integer), in units of degrees
Celsius, scaled by a factor of 100.0

For example,

       DN = 2531  denotes a temperature of 25.31 degrees Celsius.
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,638)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI SKYRAD
These are the values for the full hemisphere downwelling sky irradiance, for
each of the 5 ASTER channels.  They must be supplied in units of 
milliWatts per square meter per micrometer.
.VARI EMIS
These are the spectral emissivity values assumed when computing the amount
of reflected downwelling radiance in the input, and when using the Planck
function to convert from radiance to temperature.  Five values are required,
one for each ASTER channel from Channel 10 to 14.
.VARI INTERP
In the default mode, linear interpolation is used between lookup table
entries.  If the keyword NO is supplied, no interpolation is performed,
and the closest table entry is used.
