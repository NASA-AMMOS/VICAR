     GARSLOG is a program to log into VICAR format satellite image data that
is currently in the "GARS" format. GARS format is used by the University of
Wisconsin for tape output.  A number of sensor sources are supported, most
commonly GOES, NOAA, and TIROS series satellites. 
     The input dataset should alreadly be VICAR labelled (by CONVIM or some
similar means). There are no parameters other than input and output datasets.
