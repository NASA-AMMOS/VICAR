C130RECT
.HELP
PURPOSE:
C130RECT removes panorama distortion in images acquired by scanners that
sample at equal angular increments. Tilt can be corrected and the aspect 
ratio of the image can be adjusted.
 
EXECUTION:
 
Example 
	C130RECT  INP  OUT  DEFL=30.0  TILT=11.4  SCALE=1.5
 
	In this example, C130RECT will remove the scanning distortion
	in image INP, using a 30 degree deflection from edge to center,
        an expansion factor of 1.5, and a center 11.4 degrees off nadir.
 
 
OPERATION:
The program is essentially divided into three parts.  The first of these
handles simple initialization and computes (using basic trigonometry) 
values for the variables which are dependent on the image tilt and scan
width.  The second part of the program fills a resampling address array
which, for each input pixel position, gives a real-valued index into
the input buffer from which values may be interpolated; this array mapping
may be dumped to the screen by specifying the DEBUG option.  The third part
of the program reads in each line of the image, and using the resampling
address array and c routine resamp, corrects each line for distortion
according to the tilt and scan width specified, finally outputing each 
line to the output image.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input image file
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image file
.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard VICAR size field
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample - must be 1
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples -
 must be equal to input NS
.VARIABLE DEFL
Scan deflection from center,
in degrees
.VARIABLE TILT
Pointing angle of the central
pixel, in degrees from nadir
.VARIABLE SCALE
Expansion factor
.VARIABLE DEBUG
Prints resampling table
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE DEFL
DEFL indicates the full deflection from nadir (or from the tilt angle, if
the parameter TILT is being used), in degrees.  (Default is 38.28, the
proper value for TIMS processing. 42.96 is the correct value for MASTER.)
.VARIABLE TILT
TILT is the off-nadir tilt in degrees.  (Default=0.0.)
.VARIABLE SCALE
SCALE specifies the expansion (>1.) or contraction (<1.) factor in the
sample direction for altering the aspect ratio.  (Default=1.0.)
.VARIABLE DEBUG
The keyword parameter DEBUG causes the resampling transformation look-up 
table to be printed.
