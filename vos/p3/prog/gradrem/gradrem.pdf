GRADREM
.HELP
PURPOSE:
Wide angle aircraft scanners often exhibit large, systematic, and non-linear
artificial brightness gradients along scan lines.  GRADREM seeks to remove
these gradients by ratioing the input picture with an estimate of the gradient
upon a flat field.

EXECUTION:

Example 
	GRADREM INP=A OUT=B SIZE=(50,100,500,500) LINC=10 PERCENT=2.0

	In this example, every tenth line of the entire region specified by the
	SIZE parameter is used to compute the gradient function.  The output
	picture will be about 2.0 percent saturated (1.0 high, 1.0 low).

	GRADREM INP=A OUT=B LENGTH=300 GAIN=150.0

	In this example, the first 300 lines are used to compute the
	gradient function.  DNout = 150.0 * (DNin / gradient).

	GRADREM INP=A OUT=B 'NOSAT

	In this example, the entire region is used to compute the gradient
	function; the program sets the offset (OFF) to 0 and chooses a
	gain such that no unsaturated input pixel becomes saturated in the
	output image.  


OPERATION:
The user selects a region of the picture whose differences in brightness
are believed to be predominantly artificial.  The lines in this region are
averaged to produce a 'standard' DN level at each sample.  If requested, a
box filter is used to smooth the standard DN function.  Each pixel is then
ratioed with its appropriate standard DN, and the specified gains and
offsets applied.  Floating point arithmetic is used throughout.

Valid: NOSAT
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE START
START specifies the starting line of the region used to estimate the gradient.
The default is 1.
.VARIABLE LENGTH
LENGTH specifies the length of the region used to estimate the gradient.  The
default is for the entire picture to be used (as determined by the SIZE field).
.VARIABLE LINC
Every LINC-th line will be used to estimate the gradient.  Default is 1.
.VARIABLE FILT
FILT selects box filtering in order to smooth the gradient function, and
specifies the weight.  The default is not to perform any smoothing.
.VARIABLE GAIN
The output DN for any pixel is given by the formula
		 DNout = GAIN * (DNin / gradient) + OFFset.
GAIN specifies the factor to be used in the computation.  If OFF (the offset)
is specified, but GAIN isn't, the gain defaults to 100.0.  If neither GAIN nor
OFF is specified, and the user doesn't select the PERCENT or NOSAT options,
the gain is set to the input's mean DN value.
.VARIABLE OFF
The output DN for any pixel is given by the formula
		 DNout = GAIN * (DNin / gradient) + OFFset.
OFF specifies the offset to be used in the computation.  The default 
offset is 0.0.
.VARIABLE PERCENT
When this parameter is specified, the program will compute and use values
for GAIN and OFF which will lead to PERCENT percent saturation in the output
picture.
.VARIABLE NOPRINT
'NOPRINT suppresses the printing of the computer gradient function.
.VARIABLE NOSAT
The 'NOSAT option sets the offset to zero and chooses a gain such that no
unsaturated input pixel becomes saturated in the output image.
.VARIABLE MEANSIG
MEANSIG has two values: the first is the desired mean for each sample (column)
in the gradient estimation region.  The second value is the desired 
standard deviation for this region.  In this mode, GRADREM forces a gradient
removal to best approximate these values.
