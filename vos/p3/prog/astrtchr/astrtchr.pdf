 PURPOSE:

"astrtchr" is a general purpose VICAR applications program which performs 
automatic linear stretches on floating point and fullword integer pictures.
"astrtchr" can also be used to make pictures of GALGEN light transfer
calibration files.
.PAGE
 EXECUTION:

The input image may either be fullword floating point or fullword integer
data.  The SIZE parameter specifies the portion of the image that will be 
stretched and then written to the output file. The AREA parameter specifies 
the portion of the input image to use in determining the stretch limits. 
The default for both the AREA and SIZE parameters is to use the full input 
image.  Both AREA and SIZE give the starting pixel number and number of 
pixels per line instead of values measured in bytes. 

The output image may either be byte or halfword data.  The size of the output
image is determined by the SIZE parameter. 

Program "astrtchr" uses dynamic memory allocation (using subroutine STACKA)
to avoid imposing restrictions on the image size.
.PAGE
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:
      "astrtchr" INP=a OUT=b optional parameters
      "astrtchr" a b optional parameters

       Here 'a' represents the input image file name, and
       'b' represents the output image file name.
.PAGE
EXAMPLE

      "astrtchr" INP=A OUT=B  PERCENT=2 EXCL=(1000 1.0E10)

      In this example the output file B is a byte data image derived
      from the input image A.  The data format of A is obtained from the
      VICAR label for A.  The image is stretched to the default limits of 
      0 to 255. The linear stretch is defined to produce 1 percent saturation
      at each end of the output DN range.  The EXCL parameter effectively
      excludes input DNs greater than or equal to 1000 in the determination
      of the linear function used for stretching.  If the STREXCL keyword
      is specified, then the values supplied in the EXCL parameter are
      also excluded from the actual stretch operation, and are instead set
      to the REPLACE value.

.PAGE
RESTRICTIONS

1. The input image must be floating point (REAL*4) or fullword
   integer (INTEGER*4) data.
2. The output image must be byte or halfword data.

 OPERATION:

"astrtchr" is called an automatic linear stretch program because the user
does not have to specify the range of DNs in the input image to use in
defining the linear function used for the stretch.  Program "astrtchr" follows
a two step process.  The first step determines the linear function (stretch)
to use based on the contents of the input image file and options specified
by the user.  The second step applies the linear function to the DNs of
the input image and writes the result to the output file.  The net effect
is that the image is stretched to the specified limits without requiring
the user to know the range of DNs in the input image.

The way in which the linear function is determined depends on several
parameters. The AREA parameter specifies the portion of the input image
to examine in determining (perhaps approximately) the range of input DNs
for the linear function.  The range is determined as follows.  From the
portion of the image determined by the AREA parameter, the program selects
N evenly spaced pixels, where N is the value of the SORT parameter.  The
DNs for these pixels are examined and any DNs excluded by the EXCL parameter
are removed from the list of sample DNs.  This list is then sorted to produce
a sort of histogram.  The PERCENT parameter ( or the LPERCENT and HPERCENT
parameters) are then applied to the sorted list to determine the range of
DNs to use for the linear function.  If the PERCENT parameter is 0 or is
defaulted, then the minimum and maximum DNs in the list are used as the range.
Otherwise, the range is obtained by skipping the specified percentage of
DNs at the ends of the sorted list.

For example, suppose the AREA parameter specified a full 1000 by 1000 image,
the SORT parameter was 10000, no EXCL parameter was entered, and PERCENT=2
was specified.  The program would sample DNs at 10000 pixels spaced 10 lines
and 10 pixels apart.  The program would then select the 101st and 9900th DNs
in the sorted list as the range of DNs for the linear function.

Once the range of input DNs is determined, the linear function that maps
the range to the stretch limits (specified through the LIMITS parameter)
can be determined algebraicly.  This function is then applied to the input
DNs in the region specified by the SIZE parameter to produce the output
image.  Since the range of input DNs used to determine the linear function
is not necessarily the minimum and maximum DNs in the input image, output
DNs outside of the range of the stretch limits are possible.   (See the
NOCLIP parameter.)  The output data format may restrict the output DN values,
however.  For byte data output files, output DN values less than 0 are changed
to 0 and output DN values greater than 255 are set to 255. For halfword data
output files, output DN values less than -32768 are changed to -32768 and
output DN values greater than 32767 are set to 32767. 

"astrtchr" writes a history label for the output file to show what linear
function (stretch) was used to produce the output file. VICAR keywords
STRETCH_MINIMUM and STRETCH_MAXIMUM correspond to the limits of the 
input data and the output DN values to which they map. For example,
if input image DN values ranged from -1,204 to 32,431 in halfword format,
and the output limits were specified as (0,255), then the values of 
STRETCH_MINIMUM would be (-1204,0) and the values of STRETCH_MAXIMUM would
be (32431,255). These keywords are also PDS Data Dictionary keywords and 
their VICAR/PDS definitions are as follows:

STRETCH_MINIMUM
The stretch_minimum element provides a sequence of values, the first value 
representing the lowest sample value in an input image to be mapped to the
lower output limit and the second value representing the lowest output
sample value in the output image (first value in the LIMITS parameter.) 
Sample values between stretch_minimum and stretch_maximum are interpolated 
over the range of DNs as specified by other parameters of "astrtchr".

STRETCH_MAXIMUM
The stretch_maximum element provides a sequence of values, the first value 
representing the highest sample value in an input image to be mapped to the
upper output limit and the second value representing the highest output
sample value in the output image (second value in the LIMITS parameter.) 
Sample values between stretch_minimum and stretch_maximum are interpolated 
over the range of DNs as specified by other parameters of "astrtchr".

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE SIZE
Four integer values are entered for SIZE. These determine the position
and size of the portion (of the image) that will be stretched and then written
to the output file.  The default is to stretch the full input image.  The first
two values for the SIZE parameter are the starting line and starting pixel
number within the line.  The last two values for the SIZE parameter are the
number of lines and number of pixels per line.  The second and fourth values 
are specified in terms of fullword pixels instead of in terms of bytes.
Although the SIZE and AREA values are often the same in practice, they
are seen as mutually independent by the program.
.VARIABLE AREA    
Four integer values are entered for AREA.  These determine the position and
size of the portion (of the image) that will be used for sampling pixels to
determine the range of input DNs. The default is to use the full input image. 
The first two values for the AREA parameter are the starting line and starting
pixel number within the line.  The last two values for the AREA parameter are
the number of lines and number of pixels per line.  The AREA parameter differs
from the standard VICAR SIZE parameter in that the second and fourth values are
specified in terms of fullword pixels instead of in terms of bytes. Although
the SIZE and AREA values are often the same in practice, they are seen as
mutually independent by the program.  Thus the AREA parameter does not affect
the size of the output file. 
.VARIABLE IFORMAT
If INFMT is not specified, the format is obtained from the input image label. 
If the format is not in the label, real data is assumed.   In TAE command 
mode the user should enter 'FULL or 'REAL as stand-alone keywords.
.VARIABLE OFORMAT
The default format is byte data.  If HALF is specified, the output pixels
may have any valid halfword value.  In TAE command mode the user should 
enter 'BYTE or 'HALF as stand-alone keywords.
.VARIABLE LIMITS  
This parameter is entered in the form  LIMITS=(l,u) where l is the lower
stretch limit and u is the upper stretch limit.  The linear function for the
stretch is determined so that lower and upper percent values from the
sorted list of sampled pixels are mapped respectively to the lower and
upper stretch limits.  For byte output data, the default limits are 0 and 255.
For halfword output data, the default limits are 0 and 10000.  l and u must 
be valid values for the output data format.  For either data format, output
DNs are allowed outside of the range from l to u as long as they are valid for
the output data type and if NOCLIP is specified.  The image may be 'inverted' by
specifying l greater than u and specifying NOCLIP. 
.VARIABLE NOCLIP 
The NOCLIP parameter causes the range of output DNs to be limited by the 
output data format instead of by the LIMITS parameter.
.VARIABLE PERCENT  
The PERCENT parameter (or the LPERCENT and HPERCENT parameters) determines
which input DN gets mapped to the lower stretch limit and which input DN gets
mapped to the upper stretch limit.  Each of these parameters is refers 
to a percentage of the elements in the sorted list of sampled pixels.
Each of these parameters is a real number in the range from 0.0 to 100.0.  
PERCENT=p is equivalent to LPERCENT=p/2 and HPERCENT=p/2.  If LPERCENT=l,
then the input DN which gets mapped to the lower stretch limit is the element
in the sorted list l percent from the beginning of the list.  If HPERCENT=h,
then the input DN which gets mapped to the upper stretch limit is the element
in the sorted list h percent from the end of the list.  The default for these
parameters is 0 percent.  If the percent parameters are 0 or are
defaulted, then the minimum and maximum DNs in the list are used.

For example, suppose the AREA parameter specified a full 1000 by 1000 image,
the SORT parameter was 10000, no EXCL parameter was entered, and PERCENT=2
was specified.  The program would sample DNs at 10000 pixels spaced 10 lines
and 10 pixels apart.  The program would then select the 101st and 9900th DNs
in the sorted list as the range of DNs for the linear function.
.VARIABLE HPERCENT
(See under PERCENT.)
.VARIABLE LPERCENT 
(See under PERCENT.)
.VARIABLE SORT
The SORT parameter tells the program how much space to allocate for the list
of sampled pixels.  The number of pixels sampled is the minimum of the SORT
value and the number of pixels in the AREA area.  The default for SORT is 
10000.
.VARIABLE SINC     
The default for SINC is 1.  SINC is of use in generating pictures of GALGEN
calibration files. If SINC=N, then for a given line in the SIZE area the
program processes the starting pixel and every Nth pixel thereafter. Thus the
number of pixels per output line is smaller than the number of pixels per line
in the SIZE area by a factor of N.  Also, if SINC=N, the sampling is
restricted in a given line (in the AREA area) to the starting pixel and every 
Nth pixel thereafter.  This restriction is important for GALGEN files to assure
that the sorted list contains only pertinent DNs. 
.VARIABLE LINC
The default for LINC is 1.  If LINC=N, then the program processes the starting
line and every Nth line thereafter in the SIZE area.  Thus the number of 
output lines is smaller than the number of lines in the SIZE area by a 
factor of N.
.VARIABLE EXCL
One or more pairs of numbers can be entered for the EXCL parameter.  Each
pair specifies a range of input DNs from the first value in the pair to the
second value in the pair.  Any DNs of sampled pixels that lie in one of the
EXCL ranges are removed from the list of sample pixels.  The values can be 
entered as real numbers or integers to match the input file data format.
.VARI STREXCL 
Specifying this keyword causes DN values that are in the range(s) specified
by the EXCL parameter to be excluded from the stretch operation itself, not
just from the computation of the stretch parameters.  These DNs are set to
the value specified by the REPLACE parameter.
.vari REPLACE
This parameter is only used if keyword STREXCL is specified, and it supplies
the replacement value to be used for DNs excluded from the stretch operation.
.VARIABLE PRINT
This can yield a lot of numbers.  The default is to not print the numbers.
In TAE command mode the user should enter 'PRINT as a stand-alone keyword.
