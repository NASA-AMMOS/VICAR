VICAR Program TMSLOG
.HELP
PURPOSE:
 
   TMSLOG is a VICAR program that logs  Daedalus Thematic Mapper Simulator (TMS)
data.
 
OPERATION:
 
   TMSLOG takes a normal raw TMS file taken from a NASA Ames produced tape 
via CONVIM and reformats it into two files; an image file (PIX) 
and, optionally, an auxiliary calibration data file (AUX).  
   The first file (PIX) consists of the 12 bands of data in BIL format.
It may be any number of lines in length.
   The second file (AUX) is optional.  It has a record length of 42 pixels,
in REAL*4 format. The contents are as follows:

     -----     -----------------------------------
       1       Temperature of first blackbody (degrees C)
       2       Temperature of second blackbody (degrees C)
       3       DN of first blackbody in Channel 1
       4       DN of second blackbody in Channel 1
       .

      26       DN of second blackbody in Channel 12

      28       GMT time, expressed as HHMMSS.T
      29       Roll (positive is left) - two counts per pixel
      30       Data frame status     0 = good frame
                                 10-16 = interpolated data
                                 20-26 = repeated data
                                 30-36 = zero fill for data
