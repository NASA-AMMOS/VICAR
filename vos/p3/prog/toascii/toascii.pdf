.help
      TOASCII is a VICAR program to convert part or all of a VICAR image file
into an ASCII table of values.  It is somewhat similar to the program LIST, but
has the following differences:
           1. Page headers, row headers, and column headers are not printed.
              The only headers printed are, in the case of multiple output
              bands, the band numbers for BSQ images and the line numbers for
              BIL or BIP images.
           2. The output is not split into strips, even if there are many 
              columns of output.  That is, TOASCII assumes an arbitrarily large
              screen or paper.
           3. The columns of pixels output need not be consecutive or even in
              order.  For example, the user may output samples 3, 7, 1, and 6
              - in that order.
           4. The user may provide a FORTRAN format statement to descibe the
              output format.
.level1
.vari inp
Input VICAR file name
.vari out
Output ASCII file name
.vari size
Window into input
.vari bands
Window into input
in band dimension
.vari sl
Starting line
.vari ss
Starting sample
.vari sb
Starting band
.vari nl
Number of lines
.vari ns
Number of samples
.vari nb
Number of bands
.vari COLUMNS
Columns (sample positions)
to be output.
DEFAULT: Uses size field
.VARI FORMAT
Output print format
.level2
.vari inp
Name of the VICAR input file.
.vari out
Name of the ASCII output file.  This file will have no VICAR labels.
.vari size
The size parameter determines the portion of the input file to be converted
to ASCII data and output.  It is specified as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample (column)
	NL is the number of lines to be output
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.vari bands
The bands parameter determines the bands in the input file to be converted to
ASCII data and output.  It is specified as (SB,NB), where
	SB is the starting band
	NB is the number of bands to be output
.vari format
The user may override the default print format by supplying a valid FORTRAN
FORMAT statement as the value of this parameter.  For example,
FORMAT="(9X,I5,3X,I7)" would yield columns as follows:

         #####   #######
         #####   #######
         #####   #######
         #####   #######
         #####   #######
         #####   #######
Note that parentheses enclosing the full format expression are required, with
quotes enclosing the parentheses.
.vari columns
COLUMNS is an alternate method (to the SIZE field) of describing which sample 
positions are to be output.  It is an explicit list of the sample positions to
be output.  For example, COLUMNS=(4,5,6) would yield the same result as SS=4,
NS=3.  The output columns need not be consecutive or sequential;
COLUMNS=(1,9,4) will output Sample 1 as Column 1, Sample 9 as Column 2, and
Sample 4 as Column 3.
