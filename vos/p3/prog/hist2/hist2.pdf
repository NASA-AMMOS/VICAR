VICAR PROCESS HIST2
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   HIST2 is a VICAR program that accepts two inputs (byte only) and computes 
a two dimensional histogram (scatterplot). The output is a 256 by 256 image, 
with the first input displayed as the x-axis and the second input displayed
as the y-axis. The brightness of the output pixels corresponds to the 
population of the input DN pairs.
.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
2 input datasets (byte only)
.VARI OUT
256 by 256 histogram image
.VARI SIZE
The portion of the inputs to
be used, if not the entire 
image.
.VARI SL
The first image line to be
used.
.VARI SS
The first sample to be used.
.VARI NL
Number of lines used.
.VARI NS
Number of samples used.
.VARI MODE
Brightness rescaling parameter.
VALID: LINEAR, ROOT, NONE
.VARI SPIKES
Normalize to the Nth most
populous DN pair.
.VARI INC
Sample every nth sample of
every nth line.
.VARI LINC
Sample every nth line.
.VARI SINC
Sample every nth sample.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Two byte image datasets
.VARI OUT
256 by 256 histogram image. The DN at Line i, Sample j corresponds to the
number of pixels with DN j-1 in Input 1 and DN i-1 in Input 2.
.VARI SIZE
The portion of the inputs to be used, if not the entire image.
.VARI SL
The first image line to be used.
.VARI SS
The first sample to be used.
.VARI NL
Number of lines used.
.VARI NS
Number of samples used.
.VARI MODE
By default, the output is normalized by dividing each population by the
population Nth most populous value, as specified by the NORM parameter, then
multiplying by 255.
     If the ROOT keyword is used, the square root is taken prior to multiplying
by 255. This has the effect of compressing the high values and expanding the low
values.
     If the NONE keyword is used, no rescaling or normalization is performed.
The output is the number of pixels in each population. When NONE is specified,
the output is fullword integer, otherwise the output is byte.
.VARI SPIKES
     This parameter is analogous to the SPIKES parameter in HIST (and
elsewhere). The N most populous values are set to 255, and all other values
are rescaled to be in the proper proportion to the Nth most populous value.
.VARI INC
To form the histogram, only every nth sample of every nth line is used,
starting with the first sample of the first line. INC=n has the same effect
as LINC=n and SINC=n. The specification of INC will override the values given
by LINC and SINC.
.VARI LINC
To form the histogram, only every nth line is used, starting with the first
line.
.VARI SINC
To form the histogram, only every nth sample is used, starting with the first
sample.
