PURPOSE:

INSECT is a VICAR applications program which combines two pictures
of unequal size into one composite picture.  INSECT may be used to
mosaic two pictures or to replace a portion of one picture with a 
portion of another. 

INSECT creates an output picture with its size given by the NL and 
NS.   The section of the primary input given by the SL and SS 
parameters is placed in the top left-hand section of the output
picture.  The desired portion of the second input is placed in the 
location given by the parameter INSECT.
If an output pixel corresponds to pixels from both inputs, it is 
assigned the DN of the pixel from the secondary input.  All pixels 
of the output not corresponding to any pixel in either input will 
be assigned the DN of 0.  The maximum length of an output line 
is 20000 bytes.

EXECUTION:


INSECT INP=(A.DAT,B.DAT) OUT=C.DAT SL=1 SS=1 NL=40 NS=500 +
 insect=(50,150,150,150,250,350)

If A.DAT is a 300 line by 400 sample picture and B.dat is a 200 line
by 400 sample picture, then, the above statement will mosaic the two 
pictures replacing the last 150 lines and 50 samples of A.DAT by the
last 150 lines and middle 150 samples of B.DAT. (see following example)

CURRENT COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  F. F. Moss
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Two input Image data sets.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output image data set.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The Vicar Size Field.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting Line of Primary input
.VARIABLE SS
Starting Sample of Primary input
.VARIABLE NL
Number of Lines output 
.VARIABLE NS
Number of Samples output 
.VARIABLE INSECT
1. Starting Line of second input
2. Starting Sample of second 
   input
3. Number of Lines of second
   input to be copied
4. Number of Samples of second
   input to be copied
5. Output line for Line 1 of 
   second input
6. Output sample for Line 1 of 
   second output
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The 2 input image datasets to be inserted into the output file.
The first file specified will be the Primary Input Picture.
The second file specified is the Secondary Input Picture. The Primary 
input picture is located beginning at the upper left of the output
picture, while the Secondary file will be placed according to the 
parameters specified.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output image data set.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The Vicar size field. The first two integers refere to the Starting 
Line number of the first line and the Starting Sample number of the 
first sample  to be transfered to the output data set from the Primary 
input data set.  The second two integers specify the dimensions of the 
output data set in Number of Lines  and Number of Samples.
.VARIABLE SL
The Starting Line number of the Primary input image location which will
be mapped to location (1,1) in the output picture.
.VARIABLE SS
The Starting Sample number of the Primary input image location which
will be mapped to location (1,1) in the output picture.
.VARIABLE NL
The number of lines in the output picture. NL determines the vertical 
size of the output picture.
.VARIABLE NS
The number of samples in the output picture.  NS determines the 
horizontal size of the output picture.
.VARIABLE INSECT
A six value parameter:
value 1: The Starting Line in the Section of the Secondary input picture
         to be inserted into the output picture.
value 2: The Starting Sample in the Section of the Secondary input picture
         to be inserted into the output picture.
value 3: The Number of Lines in the Section of the Secondary input picture
	 to be inserted into the output picture.
value 4: The Number of Samples in the Section of the Secondary input picture
	 to be inserted into the output picture.
value 5: The Starting Line in the Output Picture which is to correspond to the
 	 upper left of the secondary section to be inserted.
value 6: The Starting Sample of the Output Picture which is to correspond to 
	 the upper left of the secondary section to be inserted.
