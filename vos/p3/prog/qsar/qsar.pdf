QSAR
.HELP
 PURPOSE:

Program QSAR is used to add or subtract values from the data numbers in
rectangular sections of an image.  For each rectangle, the user specifies
the size and position of the rectangle and the (positive or negative) value
to be added to the data numbers of points in that rectangle.  QSAR performs
the addition and writes the resulting image to an output file.  QSAR is 
primarily used to correct flaws in images or, in conjunction with program GEN,
to generate test images.
.PAGE
 EXECUTION:

The input image may either be byte or halfword data.  The position of the 
rectangles are specified relative to the full input image.

The maximum number of rectangles that can be specified for QSAR is limited
by the TAE executive.  As of this writing the limit is 60 rectangles.
If no rectangles are specified, QSAR copies the image without making any
changes.  For each rectangle specified, the program adds the specified
value to the data numbers of the points of that rectangle. The resulting
data numbers are then checked for being valid for the data type (byte or
halfword) of the image and are adjusted if invalid.  For byte data,
data numbers less than 0 are set to 0, and data numbers greater than 255
are set to 255.  For halfword data, data numbers less than -32768 are set to 
-32768, and data numbers greater than 32767 are set to 32767.  Rectangles
are allowed to overlap.  For points in more than one rectangle, the additions
are performed in the order they are entered by the user, and adjustments
required for validity are applied after each addition.

The output image has the same data format  (byte or halfword) as the input 
image.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:
      QSAR INP=a OUT=b SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      QSAR INP=a OUT=b  SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns optional parameters
      QSAR a b (sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      QSAR a b optional parameters

       Here 'a' represents the input image file name, and
       'b' represents the output image file name.

EXAMPLES

1.    GEN A NL=250 NS=250 IVAL=0 LINC=0 SINC=0
      QSAR INP=A OUT=B AREA=( 1   1  250   50   50     +
                              1  51  250   50  100     +
                              1 101  250   50  150     +
                              1 151  250   50  200     +
                              1 201  250   50  250       )

      In this example the output file B is a 250x250 byte image
      consisting of five vertical strips of different shades of gray.
.PAGE
2.    GEN QSARE NL=10 NS=10 'HALF
      QSAR INP=QSARE OUT=QSAREO SIZE=(2,3,8,7) FORMAT=HALF AREA=(4,6,3,1,100)

      In this example the output file QSAREO is a halfword image that has
      eight lines with seven pixels per line.  Data numbers for a three line
      by 1 pixel rectangle are incremented by 100.
.PAGE
RESTRICTIONS
1. The input and output images must be byte or halfword data.
2. The maximum number of pixels per line is 64000.
3. The maximum number of rectangles that can be specified is 60, as of this
   writing.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input file name
.VARIABLE OUT
Output file name
.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard Vicar size field:
Same as -  (SL,SS,NL,NS)
By default, the entire input
image is used if these
parameters are not entered.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line number
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample number
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE AREA
Specifies the rectangles and the
values to be added to data 
numbers.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE AREA
The values entered for the AREA parameter are entered in groups of five.
Each group corresponds to a rectangle.  The meaning of the values in each
group is as follows.

  First value  - starting line number of the rectangle.
  Second value - starting pixel number of the rectangle. 
  Third value  - number of lines in the rectangle.
  Fourth value - number of pixels per line in the rectangle.  
  Fifth value  - the integer value to be added to the data numbers for points 
                 in the rectangle.  For byte data, this value should be in the
                 range -255 to 255.  For halfword data, this value should be 
                 in the range -65535 to 65535.

The maximum number of rectangles that can be specified for QSAR is limited
by the TAE executive.  As of this writing the limit is 60 rectangles.
If no rectangles are specified, QSAR copies the image without making any
changes.
