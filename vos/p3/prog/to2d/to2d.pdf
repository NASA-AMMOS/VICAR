     TO2D alters the vicar label of a 3-D dataset, to make it appear to be
a 2-D (1 band, BSQ) dataset. Programs that have not been modified to handle
3-D data can then be run on the dataset. The original dataset characteristics
are stored in the history label, and can be restored via the companion
program TO3D.
