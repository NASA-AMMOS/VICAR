VICAR Program AVHRRLOG
.HELP
AVHRRLOG is used to log AVHRR data that is in the format of AVHRR LAC/HRPT data
as supplied by NOAA.  LAC/HRPT AVHRR data consists of five channels of images,
at the following wavelengths:
                Channel             Micrometers
                   1               0.55  -  0.68 (0.55-0.90 for TIROS-N)
                   2               0.725 -  1.10
                   3               3.55  -  3.93
                   4              10.30  - 11.30 (for NOAA-7,-9,-11,-12,-I,-J)
                                  10.50  - 11.50 (for TIROS-N and NOAA-6,-8,-10)
                   5              11.50  - 11.50 for NOAA-7,-9,-11,-12,-I,-J
                                  Ch 4 repeated for TIROS-N and NOAA-6,-8,-10)
The data are acquired at 10 bit precision (data range 0-1023), and, after
logging, are stored as 5 separate halfword (16 bit) images.  Output images 
contain 2048 samples per scan line.

The input tape data for LAC/HRPT AVHRR data consists of one 122 byte header
record (called the TBM Header record), two 7400 byte header records (Data Set
Header records), and 2*N 7400 byte image data records (N = number of scan lines
in the image).  Prior to running AVHRRLOG, a VICAR label needs to be added to
the file, by running CONVIM, or by similar means.
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input filename,
VICAR labelled
.VARIABLE OUT
Output filenames
(five needed, one per band)
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP contains the name of the INPut file, with VICAR label applied via CONVIM,
or some similar means.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT contains the names of the output files. AVHRRLOG produces five channels of
output, with the following bandpasses:
                Channel             Micrometers
                   1               0.55  -  0.68 (0.55-0.90 for TIROS-N)
                   2               0.725 -  1.10
                   3               3.55  -  3.93
                   4              10.30  - 11.30 (for NOAA-7,-9,-11,-12,-I,-J)
                                  10.50  - 11.50 (for TIROS-N and NOAA-6,-8,-10)
                   5              11.50  - 11.50 for NOAA-7,-9,-11,-12,-I,-J
                                  Ch 4 repeated for TIROS-N and NOAA-6,-8,-10)
The output datasets are halfword (16 bit) images, 2048 samples per line.
