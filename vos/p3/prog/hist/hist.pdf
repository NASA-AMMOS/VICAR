VICAR Program HIST
.HELP
PURPOSE:
HIST prints DN-frequency histograms of one or more areas of an input data
set. It is accepts BYTE, HALF, FULL, and REAL image data types and allows 
the user to specify the maximum number of bars to be used in the graph, 
as well as the range of values which those bars represent. There are several
options available for the print format of the output. The DN axis may be
aligned vertically using 80 columns (NORMAL) or 132 columns (WIDE); or, the
DN axis can be horizontal and formatted to fit within a 23x80 screen (SCREEN).
The WINDOW and WBAR options plot to IDL windows.  If PPLOT is 
specified, the histogram is generated as a line plot on the printer. The 
SCREEN mode works only on byte data, and the WINDOW and WBAR modes will not 
run in batch. The PPLOT option and one of the other options may be run in the 
same execution.
.page
Note that HIST does not determine the histogram limits: these must be
set by the LIMITS parameter, which defaults to (0,255) for byte, or to
(-32768,32767) for other data types. (To obtain an estimate of the DN
range in an image, use the keyword NOHIST in a preliminary run, then
run HIST again with suitable LIMITS.)
.page
Examples

HIST A 

This command will print out an 80-column-format histogram of input image A
based on A's full area.  The histogram will be normalized such that the
first and second most frequent values are each represented by a fifty
character bar. (This is determined by the graph display format, the default
narrow format in this case, and by the default for the SPIKES option; the
wide-graph format has a different default normalization procedure which prints 
the graph so that the largest bar is 100 characters and all other bars are
proportional.  This narrow format allows the user to see in detail the size
of the shorter bars when some bars are much larger than others.  The SPIKES
option described here is described in more detail below.  The default is
SPIKES=1.) Pixel values will be distributed among a maximum of 256
(default) bars as appropriate; the default range of pixel values to accept
is 0 through 255 for byte data, and -32768 through 32767 for halfword,
real, and integer data. 
.page
HIST A BINS=21 LIMITS=(0.0,40.0) FORMAT=HALF

This command will print out an 80-column histogram as above, but will use
21 bins, evenly spaced, with centers from 0.0 to 40.0. The width of each bin,
then, is 2.0. There are, in addition, two bins to keep track of pixels which
are outside of the specified limits. These bins are also represented by 
labeled bars on the graph.  Note that the FORMAT option was used to specify 
that the image is to be read as HALF data; the default is to read the image 
data format from the image's system label. (The allowable data types are 
BYTE, HALF, FULL, and REAL.)
.page
HIST A 'SCREEN 'PPLOT TITLE="TRONA CLASSIFICATION RESULTS"

This command will plot the histogram of A, with DN values running horizontally
across the 80 column screen, and the populations running vertically. The 
format is set to allow viewing of the entire histogram at once. The bins are 
compressed as needed to fit on the screen, and only byte data is permitted for
the screen option. The PPLOT keyword causes a pen plot to be generated on the
printer, in addition to the screen histogram. The value of the TITLE 
parameter is put as a caption to the plot.
.page
HIST A 'WIDE AREA=(1,1,15,15)

This command will print out another histogram of image A, this time using
the wide (132 column) format.  Only the first 15 samples of the first 15
lines of the image will be plotted on the graph. 

HIST A AREA=(1,1,15,15,100,100,10,40) BINS=300

This command will print two graphs in the narrow format, using a maximum of
three hundred bars to represent the data.  The range of the bars will be
either of two defaults: 0 through 255 if image A is in byte format, and
-32768 through 32767 if the image is in another, larger format.  Note that
the request is for two graphs of the same image.  The first graph will be
for the area (1,1,15,15) and the second will be for the area
(100,100,10,40).  If the 'WIDE option is used, these graphs will be labeled
with headers giving the area represented; the default, compact histogram
does not give this information. 
.page	
HIST A SPIKES=3 LINC=2 SINC=3

This command will produce a histogram of image A for which only every third
sample of every second line will be read.  This is done mainly to speed
output of the program.  Note that there is also an INC option which may be
set to any similar increment, in effect setting LINC and SINC to the same
value.  Again, this is done mainly to speed processing of the image.  Note,
too, the use of the SPIKES option.  As mentioned in the example above,
SPIKES specifies the bar which is to be normalized to a bar value of 50,
which is the maximum; any values larger than this value will be reduced to
50, and the graph will indicate the rank of each bar which is 50 units
long.  This option, in effect, removes any large spikes in the graph which
would otherwise dwarf smaller bars in the narrow format.  The default value
of SPIKE is one.

OPERATION:
The main part of the program, MAIN44, sets up defaults and handles most of
the options requested by the user, modifying variables and setting flags. 
MAIN44 then calls subroutine WORK (through STACKA for dynamic storage
allocation). 

WORK goes through each of the areas of the image, reading the lines which
are part of the area, and sorting pixels into buckets based on the number
of buckets and their range.  The bucket width equals the difference between
the limits of the range, divided by the number of buckets minus 1. The 
variables SUM and SUM2 are updated for each pixel to be used later for the 
calculation of the mean and standard deviation.  

Finally, when the entire area has been read in, PHIST, SHIST, or PLOTXY is 
called to dislay the histogram data, and the next area for the image, if any,
is similarly processed.

.vari SIZE
SIZE specifies the portion of the input image which is to be processed by 
the program.  It contains 4 integers:

(Starting Line, Starting Sample, Number of Lines, Number of Samples).

These can also be specified separately by the parameters SL, SS, NL, and NS.
.vari BANDS
If the input data is in 3-D format, BANDS specifies the starting band
desired, and the number of bands to be processed. Note that the output
histogram will be an aggregate of all bands requested.
.vari SL
See SIZE.
.vari SS
See SIZE.
.vari SB
For 3-D data, this parameter denotes the first band to be included in the
processing.
.vari NL
See SIZE.
.vari NS
See SIZE.
.vari NB
For 3-D data, this parameter denotes the number of bands to be included in
the processing.
.VARIABLE FORMAT
FORMAT specifies the input image data type and may have any of four values:
BYTE, HALF, FULL, or REAL.  If FORMAT isn't specified, each image will
be treated as being in the data format specified by its system label.
.VARIABLE SPIKES
SPIKES=N specifies that the printed histogram will be normalized in frequency 
such that the N-th most frequent value is printed as the full width on 
the page.  All values which occur more frequently will also be represented 
by a full width bar, ranked by number on the right side. 

 SPIKES may have any value from 1 to 9, inclusive; the default is 1
.VARIABLE SINC
SINC=N specifies that every N-th sample in the chosen area is to be used.
The default is for every value to be used.

Note that if INC is specified, this parameter is ignored. (INC specifies
SINC and LINC.)
.VARIABLE LINC
LINC=N specifies that every N-th line in the chosen area is to be used.  The
default is for every value to be used.

Note that if INC is specified, this parameter is ignored. (INC specifies
SINC and LINC.)
.VARIABLE INC
INC=N specifies that every N-th sample in both dimensions in the chosen area 
is to be used.  Use of this keyword speeds histogram compilation.  The
default is for every pixel in the area to be used. 

This keyword overrides any values of SINC or LINC that are specified 
separately.
.VARIABLE AREA
AREA is used to specify the portion(s) of the input image which is/are to
be graphed.  If AREA is not specified, the program will use the entire image
as determined by the label of the input file.  Several areas may be specified
using the one keyword.
.VARIABLE MODE
    NOHIST - Only the statistical data (mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
             maximum, and number of pixels) is printed. No histogram is formed.
    NORMAL - (Default) An 80 column wide histogram is formed, with DN values 
             running vertically.
    WIDE   - A 132 column wide histogram is formed, with DN values running 
             vertically.
    SCREEN - A 22 row by (up to) 80 column histogram is formed, with DN values 
             running horizontally. The is designed to fit within a single 
             screen. Byte is the only permissible data format for this option.
    WINDOW - A line plot of the histogram data is formed, using a window and
             run through IDL software. It requires a terminal with windowing
             software.  After the plot is displayed, the user is given the
             option of also producing a hardcopy plot of the data.
    WBAR   - A bar graph of the histogram data is formed, using IDL and
             windowing software.  This is the window equivalent of the BAR
             option.
.VARIABLE PPLOT
This keyword is used to generate a plot on the printer. It may be used with 
any of the MODE options. However, if MODE is defaulted and PPLOT is specified,
no histogram is output to the terminal or log file. The WINDOW and WBAR options
automatically ask the user whether a printed plot is desired.
.VARIABLE TITLE
This title is placed beneath printed plots. It has no effect if PPLOT is not
specified. In addition to this line of annotation, two other caption lines
are always generated for pen plots. One line contains the histogram
statistics, while the other lists the file name, area, linc, and sinc.
.vari NOCUM
NOCUM specifies that the percentages printed for each bin in the WIDE format
 are the percentage of the pixels in each bin, instead of the cumulative
percentage of all bins up to and including the current one, which is the
default.

If the wide-format option has not been specified, this keyword is ignored.
.VARIABLE BINS
BINS specifies the maximum number of buckets to be used in sorting image
pixels.  The default is 256.
 
Note that the range spanned by these bins is determined by the LIMITS
parameter, and defaults to (0,255) for byte, (-32768,32767) for non-byte.
 
The value of the midpoint of each bin is printed on the output histogram
lines.
.VARIABLE LIMITS
LIMITS specifies the upper and lower bounds of the histogram.  The defaults
are 0 and 255 for byte data, and -32768 and 32767 for halfword or fullword
integer and real data.

.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
Exclude 0 DN pixels from the mean and standard deviation values reported
at the end of the histogram. This does not affect the histogram itself.
.VARIABLE BYCHAN
Under normal operation a single histogram is produced, including all bands
specified by the BANDS parameter.  If the BYCHAN keyword is used, a
separate histogram for each requested band is produced.
.VARI PAUSE
PAUSE specifies that the program is to pause when the screen is filled
in interactive mode.  Default is for the program not to pause every 23 lines.
This parameter has no effect in batch mode. 
.VARI MEAN
This is an output parameter. When HIST has completed running, this parameter
contains the mean value of the last histogram. This value may be used by
subsequent programs within a procedure by declaring MEAN as a local real
variable in the procedure.
.VARI SIGMA
This is an output parameter. When HIST has completed running, this parameter
contains the value of the standard deviation for the last histogram. This 
value may be used by subsequent programs within a procedure by declaring 
SIGMA as a local real variable in the procedure.
.VARI MIN
This is an output parameter. When HIST has completed running, this parameter
contains the minimum value for the last histogram. This value may be used by 
subsequent programs within a procedure by declaring MIN as a local real 
variable in the procedure.
.VARI MAX
This is an output parameter. When HIST has completed running, this parameter
contains the maximum value for the last histogram. This value may be used by 
subsequent programs within a procedure by declaring MAX as a local real 
variable in the procedure.
.END
