VICAR/IBIS Program xyzpic

PURPOSE

    xyzpic takes an three dimensional (3-D) IBIS graphics-1 
file of (line, sample, DN value) triplets and creates an image 
of all zero value pixels except for those pixels indicated in 
the graphics file.  Any coordinates off of the image are ignored.
The DN values are clipped to fit within the DN range of the format
of the output pixels.  The points in the graphics file may be
in any order (sorting is performed by the program).  The line, sample
position of the points is rounded to the nearest pixel, while
the DN value is truncated for integer output formats.


EXECUTION

xyzpic INP=POINTS.GRA  OUT=FILE.IMG  NL=3000 NS=5000 FORMAT=HALF





RESTRICTIONS

The maximum output line length is 64,000 samples.
