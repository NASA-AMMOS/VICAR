.TITLE
VICAR Program TGEOM2
.HELP
PURPOSE
      TGEOM2 is the third and final program in the triangular geometric
rectification sequence, following TRIGRID and TGEOM1.  TGEOM2 accepts as input
the rectification dataset that was output by TGEOM1 and the raw image to be
rectified.  It produces as output the geometrically rectified image of the
second input.  The user may choose between bilinear and nearest neighbor
interpolation methods.

RESTRICTIONS:          
      TGEOM2 reads the entire raw image into memory.  This can result in
swapping and similar efficiency problems for large input images.  The point
at which this becomes a problem depends upon the size of the input image, 
the amount of memory on the machine, and the loading of the machine by other
jobs.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
(1) Rectification dataset
(2) Image to be transformed
.VARIABLE OUT
Transformed image dataset
.VARIABLE SIZE
VICAR Size field, in
output image coordinates
.VARIABLE SL
Start Line, output image
.VARIABLE SS
Start sample, output image
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines output 
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples output 
.VARIABLE INTERP
Interpolation Method.
Valid: BILINEAR, NOINTERP
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The first input image must be the rectification dataset produced by TGEOM1.
The second input dataset must be the raw image to be rectified.
.VARIABLE OUT
Transformed image dataset
.VARIABLE SIZE
This refers to the size field (StartingLine,StartingSample,NumberLines,
NumberSamples) in output image coordinates, which is the same as the subarea
from the first input.  It does not affect the second input (the raw image)
at all.
.VARIABLE SL
This is the number of the first line of the rectification dataset to be used,
to produce the first line of the output dataset.
.VARIABLE SS
This is the number of the first sample of the rectification dataset to be used,
to produce the first sample of the output dataset.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines output 
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples output 
.VARIABLE INTERP
Two interpolation methods have been implemented, selectable by this keyword.
BILINEAR specifies the use of a bilinear interpolation scheme, while NOINTERP
is specicied when the nearest neighbor approach is desired.
