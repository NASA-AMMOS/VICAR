PURPOSE:

   TMSCAL is a program which decalibrates Daedalus 12 Channel TMS data which
have already been logged with the program TMSLOG.  By default, it outputs all 
channels in radiance units (microWatts per square centimeter per steradian
per micrometer).  Optionally (if 'TEMP or 'ITEM is specified), the thermal IR
channels may be output in units of hundredths of degrees Celsius. The 
output is a band interleaved by line (BIL) data set of all twelve bands in 
two byte integer (HALF) format.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
TMS image file,
auxiliary calibration file.
.VARI OUT
output data set of all 12 bands
of calibrated TMS data.
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI MODE
This keyword selects the type
of decalibatrion to be performed
on the thermal channels
Valid:
   TEMP or ITEM for temperature
   RAD or IRAD for radiance
.VARI FILTER
Filter width for calibration
data smoothing.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
(1) The file containing all 12 bands of a TMS image in BIL format,
        which has been output from TMSLOG.
                Example: INP(1) = TMS.PIX
(2) The file containing the auxiliary calibration data set, the second
        output for a given flight line from TMSLOG.
                Example: INP(2) = TMS.AUX
.VARI OUT
  THE output data set in INTEGER*2 (HALFWORD) format of all 12 channels
  of calibrated TMS data.  The exact type of data output (i.e. temperature
  or radiance) is determined by the MODE parameter.
                Example: OUT = TMS.CAL
.VARI SIZE
  The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will calibrate the entire 
  dataset.
                Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,500)
.VARI SL
  Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
  Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
  Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
  Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI MODE
  This keyword selects the type of decalibatrion to be performed on
  Channels 11 and 12, the thermal IR channels.
  There is a choice of two possibilities:
       RAD - for decalibration to radiance units
             IRAD is synonymous with RAD, and is permitted for compatibility
             with the operation of TIMSCAL
      TEMP - for decalibration to temperature units (Celsius)
             ITEM is synonymous with TEMP, and is permitted for compatibility
             with the operation of TIMSCAL
.VARI FILTER
	This selects the width of the filter used to smooth the calibration
	file data.  Its value must be an odd integer.
