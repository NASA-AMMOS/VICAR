VIC2ENVI
.HELP
PURPOSE:
VIC2ENVI creates an ENVI header file (.hdr) for a VICAR labelled file.  The
input VICAR file will remain unaltered, and may be used for further 
processing under VICAR.  Upon completion of the program VIC2ENVI, the file
may also be accessed by ENVI, without the need for the user to supply image
size and format information.
 
Example:
	VIC2ENVI vicarfile

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input VICAR image file name
.VARIABLE PC
Use to go from unix to PC
platforms
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
This is the name of the input VICAR image file.  The contents of this file
are not changed by this program.  A separate ENVI header file, a file with
a ".hdr" extension is created as output.
.VARIABLE PC
The header (.hdr) file that gets created is an ASCII text file, and the
newline conventions differ on unix workstation and PC platforms. The PC
option creates a header file with correct newlines for use on a PC, even
when generated on a unix system.  If the ENVI use and the VICAR use are
on the same type of platform (either both unix or both PC), this keyword
is not needed.
