TAE PROCESS MASTIR
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   MASTIR is a program that accepts as input MAS TIR (Channels 42-50)
radiance at sensor image data and outputs upwelling radiance at surface for
those channels.  Also required as input are a valid MODTRAN input file,
to define the atmospheric model, and a MAS TIR spectral response file.


OPERATION:

   MASTIR takes as input the 9 Channels of MAS TIR radiance at sensor data
in units of Watts per square meter per steradian per micrometer, and a file
containing the the MAS TIR spectral response functions. This second
file must be a VICAR labelled file consisting of nine lines (one for each TIR
channel) and 900 samples (one for the spectral response at each wavenumber
from 601 to 1500). The spectral response functions must be normalized, i.e.,
the sum of all values on each line must be 1.0.
   The atmospheric model used is defined by a user supplied MODTRAN input
file.  MASTIR uses these parameters to run MODTRAN twice; once with a nadir
looking geometry, and once for the case of viewing at maximum deflection
from nadir.  From these two runs, the atmospheric transmittance, path
radiance, and downwelling sky radiance at surface are calculated for the nine
MAS TIR bandpasses.  The downwelling sky radiance values are placed in the
VICAR label of the output dataset.
   Values of transmittance and path radiance are calculated for each pixel
location in the scene by interpolation, where it is assumed that each
quantity varies linearly with path length.
   The upwelling radiance at surface is then computed by the following 
formula:

        Rad(at sensor) = RAD(upwelling)*transmittance + Rad(path)

It should be noted that the output quantity (upwelling radiance) of MASTIR
differs from the output quantity of TIMSCAL2 (surface emitted radiance). It
it includes both the surface emitted component plus the surface reflected
component.
   The output dataset consists of 9 channels of halfword (16 bit signed
integer) pixels, in units of milliWatts per square meter per steradian per
micrometer.  Note that these units are 1000 times smaller than the input
units.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
(1) MAS TIR radiance at
    sensor image, Bands 42-50
(2) MAS TIR calibration file
.VARI OUT
Output data set of the 9 MAS
TIR bands, for upwelling
radiance at surface.
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR2 output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI MODINP
Dataset name for the MODTRAN
input file, containing the
atmospheric data relevant to
this image.
.VARI MODOUT
Dataset name for MODTRAN
output report file.
.VARI MODTAB
Dataset name for MODTRAN
output tabular file.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The first file should contain the 9 channels of MAS TIR image data,
calibrated as radiance at sensor, in units of Watts per square meter per
steradian per micrometer.

The second file should be the MAS TIR calibration file (in VICAR format)
that is in effect for the date of data acquisition.
.VARI OUT
The output dataset will contain upwelling radiance at surface data for the
ten MASTER TIR channels (Channels 42 to 50), in units of milliWatts per
sqare meter per steradian per micrometer.  Output pixels are halfword
(16 bit signed integer).
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will process
the entire data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,716)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
This parameter is ignored. The full width of the input (716 samples) is
always processed.  SS is forced to be 1.
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
This parameter is ignored. The full width of the input (716 samples) is
always processed.
.VARI MODINP
   The atmospheric and geometric parameters needed by this program to run
   MODTRAN are supplied by the user providing a valid MODTRAN input (TAPE5)
   file.  This file may be generated by the stand alone program "modin",
   or by any other means convenient to the user.
.VARI MODOUT
   As a default, the report file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODOUT, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset. If a dataset name is not given
   as a parameter, but one is supplied in the MODTRAN input file, then the
   report file is saved under that name.
.VARI MODTAB
   As a default, the tabular file generated by MODTRAN is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to MODTAB, the report for the nadir looking case
   of MODTRAN is saved in that dataset. If a dataset name is not given
   as a parameter, but one is supplied in the MODTRAN input file, then the
   tabular file is saved under that name.
