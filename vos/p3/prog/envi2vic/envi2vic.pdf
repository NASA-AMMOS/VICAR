.HELP
PURPOSE:
ENVI2VIC takes as input an ENVI image file (that is, a file that has an
associated ".hdr" ENVI header file) and creates as output a VICAR labelled
file.
 
Example 
	ENVI2VIC envifile vicarfile

	There are no optional parameters, and only the ENVI image file
	(not its header file) should be given as input.
 
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE ENVI
Input ENVI image file name
.VARIABLE OUT
Output VICAR labelled file
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE ENVI
This is the name of the input ENVI image file.  It must have associated with
it an ENVI header file.  That is, if you wish to convert the file "myfile" to
vicar, there must also be a "myfile.hdr" in the same directory.
.VARIABLE OUT
This is the name of the VICAR labelled file that will be produced as output.
