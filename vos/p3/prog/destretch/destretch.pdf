	Program DESTRETCH
.HELP
PURPOSE:
        DESTRETCH produces decorrelation stretched images, and variants of
the decorrelation stretch algorithm.  This is similar to the ASTER Standard
Data Product algorithm, with a few additional options (DSCALE, more than 3
inputs/outputs, and multiple statistics gathering regions).
        The net effect of DESTRETCH is to obtain an output image whose pixels
are well distributed among all possible colors, while preserving the relative
sense of hue, saturation, and intensity of the input.

OPERATION:

The input image is first statistically sampled, using the INC and AREA, 
parameters to select the sampling grid and region(s) of interest. The
user may choose to exclude all pixels that have a zero value in all
input channels, via the EXCLUDE parameter, or choose to exclude certain
selected pixels by providing an ASTER style QA plane as an input file and
specifying it by the QA parameter.  The channel by channel means and 
variances are computed, as well as the interchannel correlation (optionally, 
covariance) matrix.

From the calculated matrix, the related eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
computed. The matrix of these eigenvectors is often called the principal
component rotation matrix.  If this matrix were used to define the output
transformation, the result would be the principal component images, the 
normal output of the program EIGEN.

A "stretching vector" (or Normalization vector) is formed by taking the
reciprocal of the square root of each element of the eigenvalue vector,
and multiplying it by the SIGMA parameter.  If the DSCALE parameter is
used, the stretching vector is rescaled by those terms.  The use of the
DSCALE parameter will re-introduce correlation into the output images,
so, in this case, the output is no longer truly a decorrelation stretch.
Use of the DSCALE parameter can, however, reduce the some of the
distracting noise often found with highly correlated images.

The transformation used in the decorrelation stretch is composed from
the principal component rotation matrix and the stretching vector in
the following manner:

                         t
                    T = R  S R

where

       T  is the output transformation matrix
       S  is the stretching vector (actually, 1xn matrix)
       R  is the principal component rotation matrix
        t
       R  is the transpose of matrix R

Conceptually,  this process is a rotation of the input image into
principal component space, stretching the individual components for
variance equalization, then a back rotation of the stretched components
into the original space. Since each of these steps is a matrix operation,
all transformation steps are combined, requiring no intermediate image
products.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
input data set(s);
Either 1 3-D file or
one file per channel.
.VARIABLE OUT
output data set(s);
Either 1 3-D file or
one file per channel.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size
 field (sl,ss,nl,ns)
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE MATRIX
Use correlation or
covariance statistics?
(Valid: CORR, COV)
.VARIABLE INC
Compute statistics from every
nth line and nth sample
.VARIABLE BANDS
Use these bands to destretch.
(Used only if input is a single
3-D file)
.VARIABLE QA
Location of QA plane, if present
.VARIABLE DSCALE
Adjust the variance equalization
scaling factors by the specified
values.
.VARIABLE AREA
The subareas to be used to
compute statistics. Up to 50
regions (SL,SS,NL,NS) may be
entered. Default is to use
the entire image.
.VARIABLE MEAN
Desired image mean for each
output channel.
.VARIABLE SIGMA
Desired image standard deviation
for each output channel.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
Exclude zero valued pixels?
Valid: EXCLUDE, INCLUDE
.VARIABLE SAVE
The name for the parameter
dataset to hold the
transformation matrix.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Input can either be a single 3-D file, containing at least 3 channels, or it
may be a set of at least 3 files, each holding one channel.  If a single file
is input, the user may specify which channels are to be used in the destretch,
by means of the BANDS parameter.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT contains the names of theoutput datasets that contain the transformed
images.  Output can either be a single 3-D file, containing at least 3 
channels, or it may be a set of at least 3 files, each holding one channel.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size field ( starting_line, starting_sample, 
number_of_lines, number_of_samples).
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line of the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample of the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines in the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples in the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE MATRIX
If the value of the parameter MATRIX is "CORR" (the default), the image's
correlation matrix is used to determine the decorrelation stretch
transformation.  If the value of MATRIX is "COV", then the covariance matrix
is used instead.
.VARIABLE INC
Statistics are gathered using only every n'th line and n'th sample of the
image, or region of interest (AREA) within the image. The parameter INC
specifies the value on "n".
.VARIABLE BANDS
If there are multiple input files, this parameter is ignored.  If there is
a single multichannel input file, this parameter specifies which of the bands
to use.  If defaulted all channels are used (up to 32).  If specified, the
user must list at least 3 bands, but no more than 32.
.VARIABLE QA
The value of the QA parameter indicates the presence and location of an
ASTER defined QA plane.  A value of 0 (the default) indicates that no QA 
plane is being provided. If the value is non-zero, then the value indicates
the channel number of the QA plane, if there is a single file input, or that
the last input file is the QA plane, if there are multiple input files.
The meanings of QA pixels are as follows:
       Pixels with a value greater than 15 are excluded from statistics
              gathering.
       Pixels with a value of 144 are replaced in the output image with
              a value of 0 in all channels.
.VARIABLE DSCALE
Under normal operation, each of the eigenvectors (and, hence, each of the
principal components) is given equal weight. If the DSCALE parameter is 
used, each successive eigenvector is weighted by the corresponding DSCALE
value. This can be used to suppress components known to be noisy, at the 
expense of re-introducing some correlation among bands.  The default is
equivalent to all DSCALE values being 1.0.  When DSCALE is used, the typical
usage is for the series of values go from large to small.
.VARIABLE AREA
Sets of (Starting_line, Starting_sample, Number_of_lines, Number_of_samples)
are given to define subareas used to generate the image statistics. 
Up to 50 set of subareas may be supplied.  The default is that the entire image 
is sampled.
.VARIABLE MEAN
A rescaling factor is included in the overall transformation to reposition the
output values in a range appropriate for byte data output. The MEAN parameter
specifies the desired mean value for the output image channels.  If the AREA
parameter has been used, this target mean is for the AREA(s) of interest only.
.VARIABLE SIGMA
A rescaling factor is included in the overall transformation to reposition the
output values in a range appropriate for byte data output. The SIGMA parameter
specifies the desired standard deviation from the mean value in each of the 
output image channels.  If the AREA parameter has been used, this target 
standard deviation is for the AREA(s) of interest only.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
If the EXCLUDE parameter is given, any pixel that has a zero value in all
input bands will be excluded from the statistics.  If the EXCLUDE parameter
is not given, the pixels are included.
.VARIABLE SAVE
If the SAVE parameter is given a value, the destretch transformation matrix
will be saved as a VICAR parameter dataset, and have the dataset name
specified by the save parameter. This parameter dataset may then be included
in the parameters for XFORM, to repeat this transformation on other datasets.
