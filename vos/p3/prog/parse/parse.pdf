VICAR Program PARSE
.HELP
PURPOSE:
PARSE separates images into their periodic components. That is, each output
is created from every nth line (HORIZONTAL mode) or every nth sample
(VERTICAL mode) from the input image, with each particular output starting
from a different line (or sample).  Its original intent was to separate one 
image into images of each component detector (sensor), but it may be used 
whenever an image of every nth line or nth sample is desired.

The user may choose to output only selected bands (for multichannel data) or
selected sensors (lines or samples). Each output image will contain the
selected sensors for one band in the BY_BAND mode, or the selected bands for
one sensor in the BY_SENSOR mode.

There is also a REVERSE mode, which performs the reverse operation.  That 
is, given multiple inputs from an image that has been PARSE'd apart, an
output image will be rebuilt.

Examples:

  PARSE ASTER_TIR (CH10,CH11,C12,C13,C14) COUNT=10

In this case, an input with 5 channels in the input file is split into 5
output images, one per channel.  Each output file will contain 10 bands,
each band is taken from every tenth input line, Band 1 starting with Line 1,
Band 2 starting with Line 2, etc.


  PARSE ASTER_SWIR (ODD,EVEN) 'VERTICAL 'BY_SENSOR COUNT=2

In this example, an input is split in two, with the first output containing
the odd numbered samples, and the second output holding the even numbered
samples.
.PAGE
  PARSE ASTER_TIR (S1,S7,S10) 'BY_SENSOR COUNT=10 SENSORS=(1,7,10)

Here, the input image is parsed by every tenth line, but only the first,
seventh, and tenth starting lines (sensors) are output.


  PARSE (CH10,CH11,CH12,C13,CH14) ASTER_TIR COUNT=10 'REVERSE

In this example, a single image is regenerated from its components.  That is,
if the outputs of the first example were used as inputs for this example, the
output would be identical to the input of the first example.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input image file(s)
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image file(s)
.VARIABLE COUNT
Number of sensors,
or, the modulus.
.VARIABLE MODE
Scan direction, or
parsing method
Valid: HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL
.VARIABLE FILES_BY
Output files will
be organized by:
Valid: BY_BAND, BY_SENSOR
.VARIABLE METHOD
Split files up (FORWARD) or put
them together (REVERSE)?
.VARIABLE BANDS
Include only the following list
of bands. (Default is to use 
all bands)
.VARIABLE SENSORS
Include only the following list
of sensors (seeds). (Default is
to use all sensors)
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
In the default method, one input is needed; the image to be split up.
In the REVERSE method, there needs to be one input file for each sensor
(if BY_SENSOR) or for each band (if BY_BAND).
.VARIABLE OUT
In the default method, there needs to be one output file for each sensor
(if BY_SENSOR) or for each band (if BY_BAND).  In the REVERSE method, 
only one output is needed; the full image to be built.
.VARIABLE COUNT
COUNT is the number of sensors, i.e., the modulus.  For example, if COUNT=6,
the input image is split into six parts, and each output file contains every
sixth line (HORIZONTAL MODE) or every sixth sample (VERTICAL MODE).
.VARIABLE MODE
In the HORIZONTAL (default) MODE, the input image is separated into its
component lines (rows).  In the VERTICAL MODE, the input image is separated
into its component samples (columns).  For the REVERSE method, this  is
used to indicate the contents of the input files
.VARIABLE FILES_BY
If the BY_BAND keyword is used, there will be one output file for each 
desired output band. Each output file will contain each of the desired
sensors as separate bands.

If the BY_SENSOR keyword is used, there will be one output file for each
desired sensor.
.VARIABLE METHOD
In the default (FORWARD) method, a single input is parsed into its components.
To rebuild the original image from those components, use the REVERSE keyword.
.VARIABLE BANDS
If this parameter is defaulted, all bands will be processed.  To process only
a subset of all bands, list the desired bands to process here.
.VARIABLE SENSORS
If this parameter is defaulted, all sensors will be processed.  To process only
a subset of all sensors, list the desired sensors to process here.
