VICAR PROGRAM FILTER
.HELP
PURPOSE:

FILTER is a VICAR applications program which performs two-dimensional
convolution filtering.  For each output sample, the program computes
a weighted average of a rectangular set of input pixels followed by
a linear transformation.  FILTER may be used to perform high-pass or 
low-pass filtering.

.page
EXECUTION:

   The following is the execution statement format for FILTER:

             FILTER INP=PIX OUT=OPIX PARAMS

   where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their res-
pective parameter sections. 
.page
OPERATION:

FILTER accepts as input a rectangular set of weights and calculates each
output point OUT(l,s) as follows:
             _                                                       _
            |  nlw nsw                                                |   /
 XXX(l,s) = | SUM SUM  IN[l-(nlw+1)/2 + i , s-(nsw+1)/2 + j] * W(i,j) |  / DIV
            |_ i=1 j=1                                               _| /
and
   OUT(l,s) = (GAIN * XXX(l,s)) + OFF
where
	IN       is the input file
	W        is the weight matrix
	nlw      is the number of lines in the weight matrix
	nsw      is the number of samples in the weight matrix
	OFF,GAIN are the SCALE parameters
	DIV      is the DIVIDE parameter
.PAGE
EXAMPLES:

1) FILTER IN OUT NLW=3 NSW=5 WEIGHTS=(0,-1,-2,-1,-2,10)
   The file will be filtered with the weight table shown below:
         0   -1   -2   -1   0
	-1   -2   10   -2   -1
	 0   -1   -2   -1   0
   The final linear transformation is
		FP(L,S) = IN(L,S) / 6
   where 6 is the default for the DIVIDE parameter, (i.e., the sum of the
   entries in the weight table).
.PAGE
2) FILTER IN OUT NLW=3 NSW=5 SCALE=(-30,1) DIVIDE=3 WEIGHTS=(0,-1,-2,-1,-2,10)
   This is the same as the example above except the final transformation is 
   given by:
		FP(L,S) = 1.0*(IN(L,S)/3.0) -30.0

3) FILTER IN OUT NLW=3 NSW=5 'UPPER DNMIN=15 WEIGHTS=(-2,5,4,3,-1,-5,20,3,1,1)
   These parameters generate the horizontally nonsymmetric weights shown
   below:
   	 -2   5   4   3   -1
	 -5  20   3   1    1
	 -2   5   4   3   -1
   and output will be computed as follows:  If the output is less
   than or equal to 15 DN, it is set to 15 DN.  
.PAGE
4) FILTER IN OUT NLW=3 NSW=3 'ALL WEIGHTS=(-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)
   These parmeters will produce a diagonal gradient picture using this weight
   matrix:  
  	-1   0   0
	 0   0   0
	 0   0   1

5) FILTER (IN,KERNAL) OUT
   In this case, the filter weights are provided in the second input file.

1. Input image file
2. (Optional) Weights as a
   VICAR image file
.VARI OUT
Filtered image file

.VARI NSW

.VARI SYMM
WEIGHTS are what part of the
weights matrix?  Valid:
UL    - for upper left quadrant
UPPER - for upper half
LEFT  - for left side
ALL   - for entire matrix
.VARI WEIGHTS
Defines the weight matrix
.VARI DIVIDE

.VARI SCALE
Linear output scaling:
(offset,scale)
.VARI DNMAX
Defines maximum output dn
.VARI DNMIN
Defines minimum output dn
.VARI RANGE
DN interval to which output
will be clipped.
(Synonym for DNMAX,DNMIN)
.VARIABLE EDGE

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The first file is the input image file that is to be filtered.
The second file, if present, contains the entire window of filter weights,
in a VICAR labelled image file.  If the second file is present, the parameters
NLW, NSW, SYMM, and WEIGHTS are ignored, since their values are either 
supplied or implied by the contents of the secon input file.
.VARI OUT
A file to write the filtered product into
.VARI SIZE
The standard size field defining the area of the input picture that is to
be filtered.
.VARI SL
Starting line of the area to be filtered.
.VARI SS
Starting sample of the area to be filtered
.VARI NL
Number of lines in the area to be filtered.
.VARI NS
Number of samples in the area to be filtered.
.VARI NLW
This specifies the number of lines of weights. Must be odd.
.VARI NSW
This specifies the number of samples in each line of the weight matrix.
Must be odd.
.VARI SYMM
This keyword parameter indicates which portion of the weights matrix is 
given in the WEIGHTS parameter.  When only part of the weights matrix is
given, the remaining parts are generated by reflection through the center
lines.
      UL     - (the default) indicates that the upper left quadrant has
               been specified.
      UPPER  - indicates that the upper half of the matrix has been given.
      LEFT   - indicates that the left half of the matrix has been given.
      ALL    - indicates that all elements of the matrix have been given.
For compatibility, the values NONSYMME and ASYMMETR are also allowed. They
have the same meanings as UPPER and ALL, respectively.
.VARI WEIGHTS
These are the weights to be used in the filter.  They should be ordered from
left to right, the top to bottom.
.VARI DIVIDE
The result of the filtering and rescaling (via SCALE parameters) is divided
by this value prior to the clipping to the RANGE parameter.
Each output point O(l,s) is given by:

        O(l,s) = GAIN*(T(l,s)/DIVIDE) + OFFSET

where GAIN and OFFSET are defined by SCALE and T is the output of the 
convolution.  The default is that the sum of the weights is used.  If this 
sum is zero, then 1.0 is used.
.VARI SCALE
This keyword specifies the application of a linear transformation to each
filtered value T(l,s):

        O(l,s) = GAIN*(T(l,s)/DIVIDE) + OFFSET

where SCALE=(OFFSET,GAIN).  Default is SCALE=(0,1).
See also DIVIDE.
.VARI DNMIN
All pixels with DN less than DNMIN upon output are set to DNMIN. 
DNMIN is synonymous with RANGE(1).
The default is the least value of the data format.
.VARI DNMAX
All pixels with DN greater than DNMAX upon output are set to DNMAX. 
DNMAX is synonymous with RANGE(2).
The default is the largest value of the data format.
.VARI RANGE
The pair of values (a,b) specifies the range of DN to which the output will
be clipped.
RANGE is synonymous with (DNMIN, DNMAX).  If both RANGE and DNMIN or DNMAX
are specified, then RANGE will take precedence.
.VARIABLE EDGE
Specifies image handling at image boundaries.  Setting EDGE=CYCLE or 'CYCLE
causes the program to treat the image as if it wrapped around at boundaries
in both directions.  'LCYCLE and 'SCYCLE cause wrap-around in the line and
sample direction only, respectively.  The default is for the program to 
reflect the image at the boundaries.
.VARI PARMS
 PARMS can be used to specify the name of an optional parameter data
 set. Any combination of the allowable parameters may be given. If
 any of the parameters are given interactively, the interactive value
 takes precedence.
