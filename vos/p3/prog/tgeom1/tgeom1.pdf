VICAR Program TGEOM1
.HELP
PURPOSE
     TGEOM1 accepts as input a triangles dataset, such as one produced by the
program TRIGRID.  It outputs a transformation (image) dataset, to be used by
TGEOM2 to geometrically rectify images. The output dataset from TGEOM1 contains
the number of lines and samples that the rectified images will possess.  It
contains two bands (BIL organization) of floating point (real) pixels.  The
value of each pixel is the location in the raw image that corresponds to this
pixel in the corrected image.  The first band holds the line number, while the
second band holds the sample number.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input triangles dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
Output transformation map 
dataset
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines in 
transformed image
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples in 
transformed image
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input dataset must have been generated by the program TRIGRID, or be
organized in the same manner.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output dataset will contain the transformation map to be used by TGEOM2 to
geometrically correct images.  The output dataset will have the number of lines
and samples specified by the parameters NL and NS.  It will contain two bands
(REAL format, BIL organization).  The first band holds the line number and the
second band holds the sample number in the raw image that maps to this location.
.VARIABLE NL
NL is the number of lines to be output by TGEOM1 and TGEOM2.
There is no default value; the user must specify its value.
.VARIABLE NS
NS is the number of samples to be output by TGEOM1 and TGEOM2.
There is no default value; the user must specify its value.
