VICAR Program TRAN
.HELP
PURPOSE:

TRAN converts images from one organization to another. It can also split a
single multichannel input into single channel files, or combine multiple
files into a single multichannel file. 

For a single input, the possible output organizations are BSQ, BIL, BIP, and
MSS. The input image must have a VICAR label and can be any format. For 
multiple inputs, each input may have one or multiple bands, and the output 
may be BSQ or BIL. For multiple inputs of multiple band files, the inputs may
be BSQ, BIL, or a mixture of the two, but not BIP or MSS.

The parameter OUTORG is the output organization.  The default for OUTORG
is BSQ.  For input MSS images, the VICAR label is BSQ with 1 band, and the
parameter NBANDS must be given so that the number of bands is known and
the number of samples per band can be determined.

The parameter BANDS is used to output specific bands into separate BSQ
files.  Up to 50 bands can be specified with each band being output to
a separate BSQ file.

Examples:

  TRAN INP.BSQ OUT.BIL OUTORG=BIL

This will convert the BSQ file into a BIL file.  The format, number of lines,
number of samples, and number of bands remain the same.


  TRAN INP.MSS OUT.BIP 'BIP NBANDS=3

This will convert the MSS file into a BIP file.  NBANDS is needed so that the
number of bands is known for the input file and the number of samples can be
determined for the output.  
.page
  TRAN INP.BSQ OUT.MSS 'MSS

This will convert the BSQ file into a MSS file.  Be aware that the VICAR
label of the MSS file will say BSQ, with the number of samples being the
number of samples of one band of the BSQ input file times the number of
bands.


  TRAN INP.BIP OUT.BSQ 'BSQ BANDS=(2,4,5)

This will convert the bands 2, 4, and 5 of the BIP file into 3 separate BSQ
files.

  TRAN (INP.1,INP.2,INP.3) OUT.BIL 'BIL

This will combine three inputs into a 3 band BIL format file.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input image file(s)
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image file(s)
.VARIABLE OUTORG
Output organization.
The choices are BSQ,
BIL, BIP, and MSS.
The default is BSQ.
.VARIABLE NBANDS
The number of bands
that the MSS input
image has.
.VARIABLE BANDS
A list of bands, up
to 50, which will be
output into separate
BSQ files.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input image can be any format. The organization can be BSQ, BIL,
BIP, or MSS for a single input, but must be BSQ or BIL when combining
multiple inputs into a single output.  
.VARIABLE OUT
The output image(s) will be the same format as the input.  If the parameter
BANDS is specified, up to 50 BSQ files can be output.
.VARIABLE OUTORG
This is the output organization.  The choices are BSQ, BIL, BIP, or MSS.
Be aware that the VICAR label of an MSS image is BSQ.
.VARIABLE NBANDS
If the input is MSS, then NBANDS must be given so that the number of bands
can be determined.
.VARIABLE BANDS
OUTORG must be BSQ.  The number of output files must equal the number of
bands listed.
