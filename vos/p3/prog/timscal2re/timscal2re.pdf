TAE PROCESS TIMSCAL2RE
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   TIMSCAL2RE is a program which calibrates TIMS data to ground radiance.  It
is similar to TIMSCAL2, except that it uses an input spectral emissivity
image, rather than a single emissivity spectrum, and that the only output
option is ground radiance.  The input is TIMS data which have already been 
calibrated to instrument radiance (in watts/...) with the program TIMSCAL,
plus a six channel emissivity image in the format produced by the TIMS suite
of programs.  The output is a data set of all six bands in two byte integer.

EXECUTION:

   The following is the execution statement format for TIMSCAL2RE:

	TIMSCAL2RE INP=(PIX,EMIS) OUT=CALPIX PARAMS

   where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their res-
pective parameter sections. 



OPERATION:

   TIMSCAL2RE takes as input the output dataset of TIMSCAL (IRAD mode, WATTS
units), plus an emissivity image in the format produced by TIMSEMIS or TIMSCAL2.
It uses LOWTRAN7 or MODTRAN (user selectable) to compute the 
atmospheric path radiance, transmittance, and ground reflected atmospheric 
radiance. These values are convolved with the TIMS instrument functions and 
the instrument perceived radiances to obtain ground radiance.  The formula 
used to compute ground radiance is:

        IRAD = [GRAD + (1.0-e)*L   ]*Trans + L
                                sky           path

   The units output for radiance images are in milliwatts/m**2/um/sr.
Output is in halfword (two byte signed integer) format.

.VARI AMODEL
	This selects the model atmosphere for which the atmospheric cor-
	rections will be computed.  The program uses a version of LOWTRAN
	(or MODTRAN) as a subroutine, to which AMODEL is passed.  The exact 
        parameters of each model is given in the LOWTRAN handbook.  The 
        options in brief:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
                RS - User supplied (e.g. Radiosonde) model atmosphere
	These same abbreviations are used with the HUMID parameter, with
	the same meanings.
		Example: LMODEL = SW
.VARI ATEMP
The ATEMP parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, with respect to 
its temperature and pressure profiles.  The choices are the same as those 
given in the AMODEL description and with the same meanings.  The ATEMP 
parameter will only change AMODEL's temperature and pressure profiles and 
nothing else.  Here are the valid strings:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: ATEMP = MW
.VARI AHUMID
	The AHUMID parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, with
	respect to its water vapor content.  The choices are the same
	as those given in the AMODEL description and with the same
	meanings.  The AHUMID parameter will only change AMODEL's water
	vapor profile and nothing else.  Here are the valid strings:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: HUMID = MW
.VARI AOZONE
	The AOZONE parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, with
	respect to its ozone concentrations. The choices are the same
	as those given in the AMODEL description and with the same
	meanings.  The AOZONE parameter will only change AMODEL's ozone
	concentration profile and nothing else.  Here are the valid strings:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: HUMID = MW
.VARI HEIGHT
	Variable HEIGHT gives the altitude above mean sea level of the
	TIMS aircraft as it scanned the particular flight line.  The
	units of HEIGHT are kilometers.  A default value of 10 kilometers
	is used as a nominal approximation of a typical TIMS overflight.
		Example: HEIGHT = 12.5
.VARI DATUM
	The DATUM is the mean elevation in kilometers of the targeted
	terrain	above mean sea level.  A default value of 1 meter is
	used if the user does not specify the DATUM explicitly.  Again,
	this variable is used only in the MODE = GRAD, GTEM or EMIS cases.
		Example: DATUM = 0.2
.VARI NLAYERS
If the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined (AMODEL=RS), NLAYERS
specifies the number of altitudes for which the atmospheric parameters are
expressed. NLAYERS has a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 61. It is not used
if one of the standard LOWTRAN/MODTRAN models is selected.
.VARI ALTITUDE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the altitudes of each of the NLAYERS of atmospheric 
layers given in the radiosonde data. The proper units are kilometers.
.VARI PRESSURE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the pressure (in millibars) of each of the NLAYERS 
of atmospheric layers given in the radiosonde data. 
.VARI TEMP
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the temperature (in degrees Celsius) of each of the
NLAYERS of atmospheric layers given in the radiosonde data.
.VARI WATER
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the moisture content of each of the NLAYERS of 
atmospheric layers given in the radiosonde data. It may be specified in units
of dewpoint temperature, grams per cubic meter, or relative humidity, as 
indicated by the WTYPE parameter.
.VARI WTYPE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the units used by the WATER parameter to denote
moisture content. The valid values are:
                       RH for relative humidity (percent of sauration)
                       DP for dewpoint temperature (degrees Celsius)
                   and DE for density (grams per cubic meter)
.VARI O3FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the ozone model in use. All ozone
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI O2FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the oxygen model in use. All oxygen
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI CO2FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the carbon dioxide model in use. All
        carbon dioxide concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to 
        atmospheric parameter computation.
.VARI SO2FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the sulfur dioxide model in use. All
        sulfur dioxide concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to 
        atmospheric parameter computation.
.VARI CH4FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the methane model in use. All methane
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI WATERFAC
	Used to vary the impact of the moisture profile in use. All moisture
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI DATE
	TIMSCAL2RE uses the date of data acquisition to determine the proper
	calibration coefficients.  If defaulted, the date in the VICAR 
	label is used. This parameter is needed only if the VICAR label
	is incorrect, or if an abnormal calibration set is to be used.
.VARI LOWFILE
   Normally, the report file generated by LOWTRAN (or MODTRAN) is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the LOWTRAN/MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to LOWFILE, the report for the nadir looking case
   of LOWTRAN/MODTRAN is saved in that dataset.
.VARI LOWTAB
   Normally, the tabular file generated by LOWTRAN (or MODTRAN) is discarded 
   at the conclusion of the LOWTRAN/MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given
   as the parameter value to LOWTAB, the report for the nadir looking case
   of LOWTRAN/MODTRAN is saved in that dataset.
.VARI ATMODEL
   This parameter selects the particular atmospheric modelling program to be
   used in the computation.  The choices are LOWTRAN (LOWTRAN7) or MODTRAN
   (MODTRAN3).
.VARI SHIFT
   This parameter is used to adjust the wavelength calibration of the TIMS
   filter functions.  This value (in nanometers) is added to the wavelengths
   in the table of spectral response functions.
