.TITLE
VICAR Program TIMSRESP
.HELP
PURPOSE:
TIMSRESP produces a plot of the TIMS response curves in effect on a specified 
date. The spectral location of these curves may be adjusted by 0.032 micron
increments.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE DATE
Date of interest, as yymmdd
e.g. 870615 for June 15, 1987
.VARIABLE ADJUST
# of 0.032 micron steps to
adjust the spectral calibration
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE DATE
The program will report the calibration that was in effect on this date. That
is, it will use the last calibration on or prior to this date. The format of
the date should be a number consisting of the last two digits of the year,
the month number (as 2 digits) and the day of month. For example, May 21, 1988
would be entered as 880521.
.VARIABLE ADJUST
The spectral calibration can be adjusted by using this parameter. The
adjustments are made in 0.032 micron steps. For example, ADJUST=2 will take
the sensor response reported at 10.000 microns during calibration and list it
at 10.064 microns.
