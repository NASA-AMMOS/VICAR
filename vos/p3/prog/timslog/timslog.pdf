.TITLE
VICAR Program TIMSLOG
.HELP
PURPOSE:
 
   TIMSLOG is a VICAR program that logs Thermal Infrared Multispectral
Scanner (TIMS) data into a format readable to the program TIMSCAL.
 
EXECUTION:
 
   The following is the execution statement format for TIMSLOG:
		 TIMSLOG RAW (PIX,AUX) PARAMS
   where PARAMS are parameters discussed in the parameter section. 
 
.PAGE
OPERATION:
   TIMSLOG takes a raw TIMS data file that has been moved to disk via CONVIM
and reformats it into two files; an image file (PIX) and an auxiliary 
calibration data file (AUX).  The input file may be in any of three formats:
the old NSTL (now Stennis) decommutated tape format, the old AMES decommutated
tape format, and (the current default) the EXABYTE non-decommutated format
from AMES.
   The first file (PIX) consists of the NCHAN bands of data in BIL format.
It can be any number of lines in length.
   The second file (AUX) is optional, and used by the program TIMSCAL to
calibrate the raw data contained in the PIX file.  It normally has a record 
length of 16 fullwords. All words are in REAL*4 format. The first two values 
have the respective temperatures of the two black bodies used for calibration, 
one seen by the sensor at the beginning of each scan sweep and one seen at the 
end.  Generally, one BB temperature should be above any seen in PIX and one 
should be below.  The next 12 values in the AUX file are the DN's of the two 
black bodies as seen by each of the six bands of the sensor.  The final two
values are the temperatures of the two ambient temperature probes.

                                         (this is the typical sequence for
                                          a non-decommutated EXABYTE tape)

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input raw TIMS file
.VARI OUT
(1) Output image file
(2) Output calibration data
.VARI SIZE
Window into input
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI TITLE
A title for the output files 
of up to 15 characters
Example: TITLE="DEATH VALLEY 11"
.VARI NCHAN
The number of sequential bands
of data
.VARI SOURCE
Decommutation mode
(EXABYTE, AMES or NSTL)
.VARI ORDER
Indicates the band order of the
interleaved data.
Example: ORDER=(1,3,2,4,6,5)
.VARI MAXBAD
Specifies the maximum number of
lines of which the band can be
out of the sequence specified 
with ORDER.
Example: MAXBAD=100
.VARI ALL
To include nav data with 
data calibration (ALL=ALL)
.VARI ORG
Organization of output pix dataset
.LEVEL2
.VARI ORG
ORG specifies the organizational format of the output image (PIX) dataset. 
BIL (the default) and BSQ are supported.  Use of this keyword has no effect
upon the AUX files generated.
.VARI SOURCE
There are three options for this parameter:

EXABYTE (the default) should be used for the EXABYTE tapes that AMES sends
        out without decommutation.  This is the current normal mode of
        operation.  These files have a logical record length of 32768 bytes.
AMES should be used for tapes that have been decommutated at the AMES
        facility. These files have a logical record length of 4188 bytes.
NSTL should be used for tapes (generally of ancient vintage) that have been
        decommutated at the NSTL (now Stennis) facility. Thes files have
        a record length of 1024 bytes, or less.
