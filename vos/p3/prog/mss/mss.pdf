.HELP
PURPOSE:
MSS combines up to 50 datasets into a single dataset with MSS format.
This is equivalent to concatenating the input images in a left to right
fashion.

EXECUTION:

Example

MSS INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D  will put images A, B, and C side-by-side to form D.

If the size parameter is used (SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS)), only the defined area in
each input image will be used to create the new file.  


OPERATION:
MSS combines datasets in the following manner:  
Each line is made up of the corresponding input lines laid end to end in
a concatenated manner.  That is, the first pixel of each input is placed
to the right of the last pixel of the previous input.  The line thus
formed will have the same number of samples per line as the sum of the
inputs. (If the SIZE field is used, it will be NS * #-inputs.)

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input image files
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output image file
.VARIABLE SIZE
INTEGER - Region of input files
to be concatenated
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of lines
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of samples
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the input data sets.  Up to 50 are allowed.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The SIZE parameter may be used when only a sub-region of each image is to
be concatenated; it has the format SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS), where the parameters
are starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.  SIZE=(1,1,10,10), for example, will cause MSS to only look
at the first ten samples of each of the first ten lines in each image, when
performing the concatenation. If NS is equal to the number of samples in the
first input file, NS from the SIZE parameter is not used; the actual number
of samples in each input file will be used instead.
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of lines (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of samples (see SIZE)
