VICAR2 PROCEDURE MINMAP
.help
MINMAP is a procedure designed to find the depth and wavelength-
positon of the minimum feature in TIMS emissivity spectra. This
is accomplished by fitting a simple, 3-parameter Gaussian function
to the emissivity spectrum at every pixel. 

The output of this procedure is a 3-band image in REAL format. The
The first band of the contains the depth of the emissivity minimum,
which is an approximation of the minimum emissivity in the spectrum.
The second band contains the wavelength-position of the minimum, given
in micrometers. Note that this value may not correspond to the central
wavelength of any TIMS channel. The third band contains the area enclosed
by the Gaussian function, again given in units of micrometers (recall that
emissivity has no units).
.page
The input to MINMAP can be any six-band image file that contains estimates
of emissivity, and is in HALFWORD format. The default input consists of
emissivity estimates that have been multiplied by 10,000 (as produced by
the MODEL EMITTANCE and BBFIT options in TIMSEMIS), but the user can 
specify any scaling factor between 1 and 32,000. Regardless of the scaling
factor, the minimum emissivity estimate at a pixel CANNOT BE LESS THAN ZERO. 
The output values for the minimum emissivity will always range between 
zero and one.

FILE.
.vari size
THE SIZE PARAMETER DETERMINES THE BOUNDARIES 
IN THE INPUT FILE FROM WHICH THE MINMAP IS 
TO TAKE PLACE.  IT IS SPECIFIED AS  
(SL,SS,NL,NS), WHERE
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.vari SCALE
This parameter allows the user to specify the value that was
used to scale the emissivity estimates into HALFWORD pixels.
The default is 10,000, but any value between 1 and 32,000 is
acceptable. It is assumed that the minimum values in the 
estimated spectra were NOT LESS THAN ZERO.
.vari RND_SEED
This parameter allows the user to specify the "seed" used
to initialize the random number generator. If this is not
changed between runs of MINMAP, the random numbers used to
initialize the iterative curve-fitting algorithm will not
not change between the runs. The final fit should be 
independent of the starting point for the algorithm, but
it is good practice to change RND_SEED before the start
of each run. RND_SEED must be specified as a 5 digit integer.
.vari DATE
This parameter allows the user to over-ride the
date present in the VICAR label of the TIMS image.
The format for entering an alternate date is:
                  YYMMDD
