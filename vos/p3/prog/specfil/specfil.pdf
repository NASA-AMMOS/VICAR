     This program produces a low pass box filtered image in the spectral
dimension for data in MSS or any of the 3-D formats. If the input is a 3-D
file with BSQ organization, on output it will be changed to BIL organization.
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input file name
.VARIABLE OUT
Output file name
.VARIABLE SIZE
Window into input
.VARIABLE BANDS
Window into input
in band dimension
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
= size(1)
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
= size(2)
.VARIABLE SB
Starting band
= bands(1)
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
= size(3)
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
= size(4)
.VARIABLE NB
Number of bands
= bands(2)
.VARIABLE MSS
Number of MSS bands,
if MSS format
.VARIABLE WEIGHTS
Width of filter
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Name of a single input file, either in MSS or 3-D format
.VARIABLE OUT
Name of a single output file. If the input is a BSQ 3-D file, the output
will be changed to 3-D BIL organization.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the filter is to take place.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.VARIABLE BANDS
The bands parameter determines the bands in the input
file from which the filter is to take place.  It is specified
as (SB,NB), where
	SB is the starting band
	NB is the number of bands to be copied
.VARIABLE SL
The first line of the input image to be processed.
.VARIABLE SS
The first sample location of the input image to be processed.
.VARIABLE SB
The first band of the input image to be filtered.
.VARIABLE NL
The total number of lines to be processed.
.VARIABLE NS
The number of samples of each line to be processed.
.VARIABLE NB
The number of bands to be processed.
.VARIABLE MSS
The number of MSS bands in the input and output images. If the input dataset
is not in MSS format, this parameter is ignored.
.VARIABLE WEIGHTS
The number of elements to be used in computing the output value of each
pixel. This must be an odd integer.
