PURPOSE

	Create an ASCII file of values from a VICAR image

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

	IMG2ASCII INP OUT PARMS

	Where valid parms are SIZE and NOTES
.PAGE
EXAMPLES

    IMG2ASCII INP=SURFACE.IMG OUT=SURFACE.TXT SIZE=(100,100,50,50) NOTES=ON

	In this example, IMG2ASCII produces an ASCII text file, SURFACE.TXT
of values from the VICAR image SURFACE.IMG starting at line and sample 100
and ending at line and sample 150. Upon program completion, with the
NOTES switch on, the min and max values encountered and the dimension of
the text file written are reported to the user.

.PAGE
OPERATION

	Only the DN values are output to the text file. The line and
sample values are not output to the text file. The program will notify
the user as to the dimension of the newly created text file (in the case
that the user specifies a SIZE larger than the input picture the output
file will trim to the max line and samples of the input picture).


RESTRICTIONS

	Converting binary VICAR images to ASCII text files will create
files that are much larger in disk storage space than the images. An image
100 square that uses 21 blocks will create an ASCII file of 134 blocks.
Currently only BYTE and HALF images function with IMG2ASCII.
