PURPOSE:
BMSS combines up to 50 datasets into a single dataset, concatenating the
input datasets in a left to right fashion.  Each dataset may have any
number of bands.  The inputs must have the same number of lines and samples 
and be of the same format (byte, halfword, fullword, or real*4).  The output
will be in BIL organization.

EXECUTION:

Example

BMSS INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D  will put images A, B, and C side-by-side to form D.

A, B, and C must have the same number of lines and samples, but
may have varying number of bands.
