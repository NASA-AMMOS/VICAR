 CONFILL --  CONtour line image FILL-in program
.HELP
      CONFILL is a VICAR program that fills by interpolation an image of
 contour lines.  The input image must consist of contour lines, each of whose
 DN is equal to the value of the contour.  The background pixels must all have
 a single DN value.  Interpolation is performed in the horizontal direction,
 and the user may choose either a linear or cubic spline interpolation.  The
 values of the outermost contours are extended to the edges of the image.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
 input contour image
.VARIABLE OUT
 (1) output filled image
 (2) [optional] image of
     horizontal distance to
     nearest contour, in 
     pixels. HALFword format
.VARIABLE SIZE
 output image window
 (SL,SS,NL,NS)
.VARIABLE SL
 starting line
.VARIABLE SS
 starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
 number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
 number of samples
.VARIABLE BACKGRND
 DN value of background pixels
.VARIABLE MODE
 interpoloation mode
 Valid: LINEAR, SPLINE
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 input data set
.VARIABLE OUT
 Either 1 or 2 output datasets may be specified.  The first dataset will
 contain the filled in image that has been generated from the contour image.
 The second (optional) dataset will contain a map of the distance (in pixels)
 to the nearest contour line used for filling that pixel in the first output.
 .VARIABLE SIZE
 image size (SL,SS,NL,NS)
.VARIABLE SL
 The first line of the input image to be output.
.VARIABLE SS
 The first pixel of each input line to be output.
.VARIABLE NL
 The number of lines to be output.
.VARIABLE NS
 The number of pixels to be output for each line.
.VARIABLE BACKGRND
 CONFILL expects all background pixels to be of a single DN value, specified
 by this parameter (Default value is 0).  All pixels with different values
 are assumed to be part of a contour line.
.VARIABLE MODE
 Two interpolation modes are currently available in CONFILL: linear and cubic
 spline.  Extrapolation, when needed, is done by extension of the outermost
 contour. The valid keywords are: LINEAR, and SPLINE. SPLINE is the default.
