TAE PROCESS SEBASSCAL
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   SEBASSCAL is a program which calibrates SEBASS data to ground radiance,
ground temperature, or brightness temperature. The input is SEBASS data which
have already been calibrated to instrument radiance (in mW/m^2...).
Output is a band interleaved by line (BIL) data set of all bands in two 
byte integer.

EXECUTION:

   The following is the execution statement format for SEBASSCAL:

	SEBASSCAL INP=PIX OUT=CALPIX PARAMS

   where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their res-
pective parameter sections. 



OPERATION:

   SEBASSCAL takes as input the radiance at sensor dataset of SEBASS data.
It uses MODTRAN to compute the atmospheric path radiance, transmittance, 
and ground reflected atmospheric radiance. The formula used to compute
ground radiance is:

        IRAD = [GRAD + (1.0-e)*L   ]*Trans + L
                                sky           path

   The units output for radiance images are in milliwatts/m**2/um/sr. The units 
output for temperature images are in hundredths of degrees Celsius.
Output is in halfword (two byte signed integer) format.

      (e.g. 19970922 for September 22, 1997).  It is used to determine
      which wavelength calibration to use.
.VARI AMODEL
	This selects the model atmosphere for which the atmospheric cor-
	rections will be computed.  The program uses a version of MODTRAN
	as a subroutine, to which AMODEL is passed.  The exact 
        parameters of each model is given in the MODTRAN handbook.  The 
        options in brief:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
                RS - User supplied (e.g. Radiosonde) model atmosphere
	These same abbreviations are used with the HUMID parameter, with
	the same meanings.
		Example: LMODEL = SW
.VARI ATEMP
The ATEMP parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, with respect to 
its temperature and pressure profiles.  The choices are the same as those 
given in the AMODEL description and with the same meanings.  The ATEMP 
parameter will only change AMODEL's temperature and pressure profiles and 
nothing else.  Here are the valid strings:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: ATEMP = MW
.VARI AHUMID
	The AHUMID parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, with
	respect to its water vapor content.  The choices are the same
	as those given in the AMODEL description and with the same
	meanings.  The AHUMID parameter will only change AMODEL's water
	vapor profile and nothing else.  Here are the valid strings:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: HUMID = MW
.VARI AOZONE
	The AOZONE parameter is used to modify the AMODEL given, with
	respect to its ozone concentrations. The choices are the same
	as those given in the AMODEL description and with the same
	meanings.  The AOZONE parameter will only change AMODEL's ozone
	concentration profile and nothing else.  Here are the valid strings:
		TR - TRopical model atmosphere
		MS - Midlatitude Summer
		MW - Midlatitude Winter
		SS - Subarctic Summer
		SW - Subarctic Winter
		ST - U.S. STandard
		Example: HUMID = MW
.VARI HEIGHT
	Variable HEIGHT gives the altitude above mean sea level of the
	sensor as it scanned the particular flight line.  The units of
	HEIGHT are kilometers.
		Example: HEIGHT = 12.5
.VARI DATUM
	The DATUM is the mean elevation in kilometers of the targeted
	terrain	above mean sea level.  A default value of 1 meter is
	used if the user does not specify the DATUM explicitly.
		Example: DATUM = 0.2
.VARI NLAYERS
If the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined (AMODEL=RS), NLAYERS
specifies the number of altitudes for which the atmospheric parameters are
expressed. NLAYERS has a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 61. It is not used
if one of the standard MODTRAN models is selected.
.VARI ALTITUDE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the altitudes of each of the NLAYERS of atmospheric 
layers given in the radiosonde data. The proper units are kilometers.
.VARI PRESSURE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the pressure (in millibars) of each of the NLAYERS 
of atmospheric layers given in the radiosonde data. 
.VARI TEMP
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the temperature of each of the NLAYERS of atmospheric
layers given in the radiosonde data.  The units of the temperature profile may
be either Celsius (the default), or Kelvin (if the keyword KELVIN has been
specified.
.VARI WATER
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the moisture content of each of the NLAYERS of 
atmospheric layers given in the radiosonde data. It may be specified in units
of dewpoint temperature, grams per cubic meter, or relative humidity, as 
indicated by the WTYPE parameter.
.VARI WTYPE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the units used by the WATER parameter to denote
moisture content. The valid values are:
                       RH for relative humidity (percent of sauration)
                       DP for dewpoint temperature (degrees Celsius)
                   and DE for density (grams per cubic meter)
.VARI TTYPE
This parameter is used only if the atmospheric model to be used is user-defined
(AMODEL=RS). It specifies the units used by the TEMP parameter to denote
atmospheric temperature. The valid values are:
        CELSIUS - the default value
        KELVIN  
.VARI O3FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the ozone model in use. All ozone
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI O2FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the oxygen model in use. All oxygen
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.

        carbon dioxide concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to 
        atmospheric parameter computation.
.VARI SO2FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the sulfur dioxide model in use. All
        sulfur dioxide concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to 
        atmospheric parameter computation.
.VARI CH4FAC
	Used to vary the impact of the methane model in use. All methane
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI WATERFAC
	Used to vary the impact of the moisture profile in use. All moisture
        concentrations are multiplied by this factor prior to atmospheric
        parameter computation.
.VARI E
        This is the emissivity assumed for each band, when computing the
        sky radiance reflected by the ground. In the GTEM mode, these values
        are also used to compute the ground kinetic temperature.
        emissivity.
.VARI RSTABLE
   If the radiosonde (RS) atmospheric model has been selected, the user may
   input the model parameters via the VICAR parameters ALTITUDE, PRESSURE,
   TEMP, and WATER, or alternatively, supply an ASCII file containing these
   values.  If the values are supplied in a file, the name of the file
   should be given for the value of RSTABLE.
         The file must be organized in the following manner:
   Column 1   altitudes in ascending elevations, units are kilometers
   Column 2   pressures in millibars
   Column 3   temperatures
   Column 4   moisture content

   If there are more than 4 columns, the additional columns are ignored.
   Column headers are permitted and ignored.  The user need not specify
   the number of layers, but if more than 61 layers are contained in the 
   file, the program will abort.
.VARI MODFILE
   Normally, the report file generated by MODTRAN is discarded at the 
   conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given as the 
   parameter value to MODFILE, the report is saved in that dataset.
.VARI MODTAB
   Normally, the tabular file generated by MODTRAN is discarded at the
   conclusion of the MODTRAN run.  If a dataset name is given as the
   parameter value to LOWTAB, the report is saved in that dataset.
