PURPOSE:

FIT is a VICAR applications program which performs automatic linear
stretches on halfword pictures anywhere in the halfword range (-32768
to +32767).  

Description of the Auto-stretch Algorithm:

FIT computes a grey level frequency table (histogram) of the input 
image.  The histogram has 65536 bins, hence spans the entire halfword
range from -32768 to +32767 

If EXCLUDE=(N1,N2) is specified, the histogram is modified by setting:

	H(I) = 0 for N1 <= I <= N2

If the INCLUDE keyword is not specified, the histogram element corresponding
to 0 DN is set to zero also.

.page
The program determines linear stretch constants IMIN and IMAX such that:

 a) IMIN is the largest I which satisfies the equation
       A(-32768,I) <= PL * A(-32768,32767)

 b) IMAX is the smallest I which satisfies the equation
       A(I,32767) <= PH * A(-32768,32767)

where PL and PH may be specified by the LPER and HPER keywords.  The values
A(-32768,IMIN) and A(IMAX,32767) represent the shaded areas under the curve in 
the above graph.  Note that A(-32768,32767) is the total histogram area, and 
represents the number of samples in the image which have not been excluded.
.page
The linear stretch which is applied to the image is defined as follows:
	
	     HV - LV
     Y =   -----------	(X - IMIN) + LV
	   IMAX - IMIN

where X and Y are the input and output DN values respectively for each
pixel.

Description of Printed Histograms and Statistics:

After computing the histogram, the mean and standard deviation of the 
input image are printed out.

If the keyword PHIST is specified, the histogram is printed out.  Since
it is normally undesirable to print all the grey levels, the histogram
is condensed so that a maximum of NLIN grey levels are printed. 
This is accomplished by determining a suitable increment M.  Alternatively, 
the increment M may be specified via the HINC parameter.  The condensed
histogram H* may be interpreted as follows:

	H* (I) = H(I) + H(I+1) + ... + H(I+M-1)

	    for I = 1, M + 1, 2 * M + 1, ...

	H* (I) = 0 for all other I.

After zeroing out the excluded elements from the histogram, the mean and
standard deviation computed from the excluded histogram are printed out.  
If EHIST is specified, the excluded histogram is printed out.  Same 
comments as above apply.
.page
The input for FIT can be any organization, BSQ, BIL, or BIP.  If an output
is desired, it will have the same organization as the input.

EXAMPLES:

	FIT  INP=A  OUT=B   'BYTE   PERC=1.

The halfword image contained in data set A is scaled to 8 bits, saturating
0.5 percent of the data at both ends of the histogram.

	FIT INP=A  'PHIST 

The halfword histogram is printed.  No output image is produced.

	FIT  INP=A OUT=B  'BYTE  PERC=1.0  EXCL=(12001,32767)

The halfword image contained in A is scaled to 8 bits as in Example 1.
However, all sample values less than 1 or greater than 12000 are 
ignored in the auto-stretch computation.

.VARIABLE INP
The input data set, always a halfword disk data set (never a tape).
.VARIABLE OUT
The output data set. The stretched version of INP. Can be halfword or 
byte as specified. Default is halfword.
.VARIABLE SIZE
4 INTEGERS - A VICAR size field. (Starting_Line, Starting_sample, 
Number_of_Lines, Number_of_samples) Default = it will be read from
the image label.
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting Line of input image.
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting Sample of input image.
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines in the input image.
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of Samples in input image.
.VARIABLE OFORM
This keyword has two valid valuse: BYTE and HALF.
BYTE specifies that the output data set is to be in byte format, with 
DN values from 0 to 255. 
 
HALF specifies that the output is a halfword data set with DN values 
ranging from LVALUE to HVALUE.

.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
EXCLUDE is composed of pairs of integers specifying the exclusion of the

to 100 pairs of values, to specify multiple DN ranges.

The default is to exclude only 0 DN.
.VARIABLE INCLUDE
INCLUDE specifies 0 DN is to be included in the auto-stretch computation.
The default is to exclude 0 DN.

Note that if the user specifies a range using EXCLUDE that includes 0, 
then specifying INCLUDE does not work;  all this parameter does is to
suppress addition of 0 DN to whatever range(s) was (were) specified
using EXCLUDE.
.VARIABLE PHIST
PHIST is a keyword specifying the histogram of the input image is to be 
printed.
Default is no histogram will be printed.
.VARIABLE EHIST
EHIST is a keyword specifying the excluded histogram is to be printed out.
.VARIABLE SPIKE
SPIKE is an integer specifying the number of spikes in the histogram. 
This parameter is used to control the scale of the frequency axis of the

maximum value (100), and normalizing all other frequencies to this scale.
Default is SPIKE = 1.
.VARIABLE NLIN

printed histogram.  This controls the number of lines printed per histogram.
Default NLIN = 256.
.VARIABLE HINC
HINC is an integer specifying the grey level increment factor for the

default is to have the program automatically compute the histogram
increment based upon the value of NLIN.
.VARIABLE SB
SB is the starting band which is to be output.  The default is 1.
.VARIABLE NB
NB is the number of bands which is to be output.  The default is the number
of bands in the input image.

BRANGE is composed of two integers which correspond to the starting band and
number of bands of the input from which the histogram is to be computed.
The default for BRANGE is the values of SB and NB.
