.help
Copy is a simple program which can be used to copy all or
part of an image to another file.  The size and bands fields
are used to determine a window into the input file.

Copy works both on labeled and unlabeled images, although for
an unlabeled image it is usually best to specify INSIZE,
FORMAT, and ORG to ensure that the proper size image is read.

To write an unblocked tape file, the NOBLOCK keyword may be given.

The maximum record size that may be copied is 200,000 bytes.
.level1
.vari inp
Input file name
.vari out
Output file name
.vari size
Window into input
.vari bands
Window into input
in band dimension
.vari sl
Starting line
= size(1)
.vari ss
Starting sample
= size(2)
.vari sb
Starting band
= bands(1)
.vari nl
Number of lines
= size(3)
.vari ns
Number of samples
= size(4)
.vari nb
Number of bands
= bands(2)
.vari insize
(nl,ns,nb) of input
if unlabeled
.VARI FORMAT
Data format iff input
is unlabeled
.vari org
File organization iff
input is unlabeled
.vari block
Block output?
.vari binary
Copy binary labels?
.level2
.vari inp
Name of a single input file.
.vari out
Name of a single output file.
.vari size
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the copy is to take place.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.vari bands
The bands parameter determines the bands in the input
file from which the copy is to take place.  It is specified
as (SB,NB), where
	SB is the starting band
	NB is the number of bands to be copied
.VARI INSIZE
The size of the input file if it has no label.  If the input file
has a label, then this parameter is ignored, and the actual file
size is used.
.vari format
The data format of the input file if it has no label.  If the input
file has a label, then this parameter is ignored, and the actual
file format is used.
.vari org
The file organization of the input file if it has no label.  If the
input file has a label, then this parameter is ignored, and the
actual file organization is used.
.vari block
If NOBLOCK is specified, then the image will not be blocked on
output, thus having one record per block.  This feature is useful
for writing tapes for foreign systems.
.vari binary
This keyword parameter may be used to tell COPY that binary labels
and prefixes must be copied along with image data.
