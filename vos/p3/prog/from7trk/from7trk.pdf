.HELP
 PURPOSE:
      The Science Digital Data Preservation Task (SDDPT) has transcribed the
data from a large number of archived 1/2 inch CCT tapes onto a set of CD-ROM's.
While the datasets transcribed from 9 track tapes are, in general, readable
by way of previously existing software, the datasets transcribed from 7 track
tapes need a reformatting step to be usable by current VICAR programs. 
FROM7TRK is a VICAR program that provides this reformatting step.
      Since 7 track tape drives were used only during the IBM era, translation
of the IBM VICAR labels (in EBCDIC) into VICAR2 (ASCII) labels was also
necessary.

 RESTRICTIONS:
      While this program attempts to handle any possible valid IBM VICAR
label, there were no available test datasets for numerous options, and a
complete list of possible valid VICAR label formats is lost to the mists
of time.  In particular, the following options have been programmed in
but not tested: non-byte data, VICAR labels longer than 360 bytes, and the
LABEL77 label format.
      If this program encounters a problem with any of these formats, please
contact the cognizant programmer listed on the following page.

.VARIABLE INP
Input file name
.VARIABLE OUT
Output file name
.VARIABLE NOADD
Use the keyword NOADD
to suppress the addition
of fill lines when missing
lines are suspected.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input file should be a file from an SDDPT CD-ROM, or an exact copy of
such a file.  The file should be originally from the transcription of a
7 track, 1/2 inch CCT tape, and contain an IBM VICAR label.  Files from 9 
track tapes, and files that have had VICAR2 labels added to them will be 
handled improperly.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output file will be a file with a standard VICAR2 label.  The history
labels from the old IBM VICAR label will be preserved as comments in the
new label.
.VARIABLE NOADD
It was observed in the test datasets that there is sometimes a "loss of
sync" when reading the input dataset.  This appears to be associated with
read errors in the original transcription from the 7 track tape, and is
usually accompanied by a missing line, lines, or part of a line.
      In the default mode, whenever a loss of sync is detected, the previous
output line is repeated, and processing moves to the nearest sync mark.
Specifying the 'NOADD option suppresses the addition of these duplicate
lines.
