TAE PROCESS TIMSCAL
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   TIMSCAL is a program which calibrates TIMS data which have already been 
logged with the program TIMSLOG.  It can output two types of data, instrument 
perceived radiance (IRAD), or instrument perceived temperature (ITEM). The
output is a data set of all six bands in two byte integer.

EXECUTION:

   The following is the execution statement format for TIMSCAL:

	TIMSCAL INP=(PIX,AUX) OUT=CALPIX PARAMS

   where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their res-
pective parameter sections. 



OPERATION:

   TIMSCAL takes two input data sets - the first is a TIMS image file and the 
second an auxiliary file for calibration, both of which are output from TAE 
program TIMSLOG.  Based upon the auxiliary file, it calibrates a TIMS image 
(6 bands), according to the type of data specified with keyword CALMODE.

   The units output for radiance images are  milliwatts/m**2/um/sr. The units 
output for temperature images are in hundredths of degrees Celsius. Output 
is in halfword (two byte signed integer) format.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
TIMS image file,
auxiliary calibration file.
.VARI OUT
Output data set of all six bands
of calibrated TIMS data.
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.VARI CALMODE
This keyword selects the type
of decalibatrion to be performed
Valid: IRAD, ITEM
.VARI FILTER
Filter width for calibration
data smoothing.
.VARI DATE
Date of data acquisition. Used
to override the date in the
VICAR label (yymmdd)
.VARI  BBEMIS
The emissivities for the 
blackbody paint, in each of
the six channels
.VARI INST_T
Instrument temperature
(degrees Celsius)
.VARI ORG
Organization of output dataset
.VARI SHIFT
Spectral shift of filter 
functions (Nanometers)
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
(1)	The file containing all six bands of a TIMS image in MSS format,
	which has been output from TIMSLOG.
		Example: INP(1) = location.pix
(2)	The file containing the auxiliary calibration data set, the second
	output for a given flight line from TIMSLOG.
		Example: INP(2) = location.aux
.VARI OUT
	Output data set in INTEGER*2 (HALFWORD) format of all six bands
	of calibrated TIMS data.  The exact type of data output (e.g. tem-
	perature, radiance) is determined by the MODE parameter.
		Example: OUT = location.irad
.VARI SIZE
	The standard VICAR2 output size field.   Default will calibrate
	the entire data set.
		Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,638)
.VARI SL
	Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
	Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
	Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
	Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
.VARI CALMODE
	This keyword selects the type of decalibatrion to be performed.
	There is a choice of two possibilities:
		IRAD - (Instrument perceived RADiance)
			Radiance values of scene with no atmospheric
			corrections.
		ITEM - (Instrument perceived TEMperature)
			Temperature values of the radiance observed
			entering the instrument, without atmospheric
			corrections.
.VARI FILTER
	This selects the width of the filter used to smooth the calibration
	file data.  Its value must be an odd integer.
.VARI DATE
	TIMSCAL uses the date of data acquisition to determine the proper
	calibration coefficients.  If defaulted, the date in the VICAR 
	label is used. This parameter is needed only if the VICAR label
	is incorrect, or if an abnormal calibration set is to be used.
.VARI INST_T
INST_T is the temperature of the portion of the TIMS instrument that is in
field of view of the blackbodies, in degrees Celsius.  This value is used to
compensate for the deviations from unity in the emissivity of the paint on the
blackbodies.  The default value of 0.0 degrees Celsius is nearly always 
acceptible.
.VARI ORG
ORG specifies the organizational format of the output dataset. BIL (the default)
and BSQ are supported.  
.VARI SHIFT
   This parameter is used to adjust the wavelength calibration of the TIMS
   filter functions.  This value (in nanometers) is added to the wavelengths
   in the table of spectral response functions.
