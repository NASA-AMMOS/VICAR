.TITLE
VICAR2 Program VTIFF
.HELP
   VTIFF is a Vicar2 program, which can be used to convert
   between VICAR labeled images and TIFF format files, using
   either scanline (strip) organization, or the newer Revision
   6.0 TIFF tiled-image format. Currently grayscale, image-
   lookup table pairs and RGB tripletes are supported. In addition,
   multiple auxiliary images may be placed in the same file,
   such as "thumbnail" preview images.

   "TIFF" is a trademark of Aldus Corporation, and is a public
   standard for platform-independent raster-image storage and
   transmission. It is an acronym for Tagged Image File Format.

.PAGE
CALLING SEQUENCE:

	vtiff-tovic   image.tiff  image 	  AUXIL=(files...)
	vtiff-tovic   image.tiff  (image, lookup) AUXIL=(files...)
	vtiff-tovic   image.tiff  (red, grn, blu) AUXIL=(files...)

	vtiff-fromvic  image  		image.tif  [options..]
	vtiff-fromvic  (image, lookup)  image.tif  [options..]
	vtiff-fromvic  (red, grn, blu)  image.tif  [options..]

   where image.tiff is TIFF format, and lookup is a
   color lookup table in IDX format (1024 sample, 1 line
   byte image, with values r1,g1,b1,0,r2,g2,b2,0,...).

   Unlike VMAC, (which this program is intended to partially replace
   as a Unix-portable TIFF converter), no support exists yet to convert
   an RGB triplet into an 8-bit image-lookup pair.

.PAGE
OPERATION

  In the "tovicar" mode, the program unpacks the image and
  lookup table, if desired. It will also unpack any additional
  files and save them as specified by the AUX parameter.

  In the "fromvicar" mode, you have the option of saving the
  files in strip-mode (horizontal scanlines contiguous), which
  makes them TIFF 5.0 compliant; or using the TIFF 6.0 tiling
  option, which breaks the image up into rectangular tiles, and
  saves those in a contiguous manner.

  You may save multiple additional images in the same file using
  the "AUX" parameter. If the file uses a lookup table, you may
  include this in the second INP parameter. It currently must be
  an IDX-format lookup table (1 line x 1024 sample byte image:
  r1,g1,b1,0,r2..). NOTE: Tiling is a new feature, which many
  TIFF programs cant yet handle. If so, use the default strip-mode. 
.PAGE
OPERATION

  You may also chose a TIFF data compression option. The
  currently supported keywords in VTIFF are 'LZW = lempel-ziv-welch
  compression, 'PACKBITS = Macintosh-style packbits (run-length
  encoding) compression, or 'NOCOMP = no compression. NOTE: The
  TIFF 6.0 standard now discourages the use of LZW, as Unisys Corp.
  claims to have a patent on the algorithm, and so may not
  support LZW in the future.

  For RGB triplets, whether tiled or in strips, you may choose
  to organize the data using 'CHUNKY or 'PLANAR interleaving.
  The 'CHUNKY format is analogous to the VICAR BIP (Band-interleaved
  by pixel) organization, and is the default. The 'PLANAR is
  similar to BSQ (Band-sequential) format, and while this permits
  faster conversion and extraction, it is an extension to TIFF
  that is not supported by as many TIFF-compatible programs.
.PAGE
OPERATION

  The latitude-longitude parmeters are extensions to TIFF to
  permit specification of scanned map georeference data. These
  extensions are TIFF-compliant, and will not interfere with
  any standard TIFF-reading program, which will ignore the 
  extended data fields. For more information on the cartographic
  TIFF extensions, contact the Cartographic Applications Group
  at JPL. Do not use these parameters if you only want standard TIFF.

  In general, for the most easily exportable TIFF file, use as many
  of the default values as possible. The parameters are set up so
  that the parameters further down the list will cause the file to
  be less exportable if their default values are overridden.

.VAR OUT -TOVIC
This parameter specifies the names of the output VICAR file(s).  There are three
options:

     If two outputs are given, the first will contain the VICAR image, and the 
         second will contain the lookup table in IDX format.
     If three outputs are given, they will contain the red, green, and blue
         color planes as VICAR images, respectively.
.VAR AUXIL -TOVIC
Auxilary files to pull out of TIFF file.

.SUBCMD FROMVIC

.VAR INP -FROMVIC
This parameter specifies the names of the input VICAR file(s).  There are three

     If one input is given, it will contain the VICAR image
     If two inputs are given, the first should contain the VICAR image, and the 
         second should contain the lookup table in IDX format.
     If three inputs are given, they should contain the red, green, and blue

  now discourages the use of LZW, as Unisys Corp. claims to have a patent on 
  the algorithm, and so LZW may not be supported in the future.
.VAR TIFFMODE -FROMVIC
  For RGB triplets, whether tiled or in strips, you may choose
  to organize the data using 'CHUNKY or 'PLANAR interleaving.
  The 'CHUNKY format is analogous to the VICAR BIP (Band-interleaved
