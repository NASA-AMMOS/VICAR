TRANSECT
.HELP
PURPOSE:
     TRANSECT is a program for plotting the values along a line within an
image. The user specifies the line and sample coordinates for the end points
of the line, and the DN's are plotted as a function of distance (in pixels)
from the starting point. The user may also designate the band (if multichannel
data), the limits of the y axis, and a title to be placed on the printed plot,
if generated.
     TRANSECT does no interpolation to arrive at the values it plots. If
the transect is mostly horizontal in the image, a value is taken at each
sample, using the nearest line. For the more vertical transects, a value is
taken at each line, using the nearest sample.
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input file name
.VARIABLE START
Line and sample of 
the starting  point
.VARIABLE END
Line and sample of 
the end point
.VARIABLE BAND
Band number (if multichannel)
.VARIABLE YAXIS
Range of y-axis
.VARIABLE TITLE
Title placed on hardcopy plot
.VARIABLE XLABEL
X-axis label (paper plot only)
.VARIABLE YLABEL
Y-axis label (paper plot only)
.VARIABLE PRINT
Print pixel values?
(PRINT or NOPRINT)
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Input file name. The file may be BYTE, HALF, FULL, or REAL; if multichannel,
it may be BIL or BSQ.  BIP is not presently implemented.
.VARIABLE START
This is the line and sample of the starting point of the transect (or DN 
profile). The value at this location is plotted at zero on the x-axis.
.VARIABLE END
This is the line and sample of the end point of the transect. The value at
this location is plotted as the rightmost value along the x-axis.
.VARIABLE BAND
If the input dataset is multichannel, BAND designates which band is to be
plotted. The default is Band 1.  
.VARIABLE YAXIS
YAXIS indicates the full scale limits of the y-axis. If defaulted, the program
chooses limits that completely span the range of the data plotted. 
.VARIABLE TITLE
The user may place a line of annotation up to 80 characters in length on the 
printed plots. This annotation does not appear on the screen, and, if a printed
plot is not requested, the value of TITLE is not used.
.VARIABLE XLABEL
When printing on the laser printer, the user may place a label on the X-axis.
The label may be up to 40 characters in length, and does not appear on the 
other plot media. The default is "Relative Pixel Position".
.VARIABLE YLABEL
When printing on the laser printer, the user may place a label on the Y-axis.
The label may be up to 40 characters in length, and does not appear on the 
other plot media. The default is "DN Value".
.VARIABLE PRINT
If the keyword PRINT is given, the pixel locations and values are printed to
the terminal and session log.  Otherwise, only a plot is made.
