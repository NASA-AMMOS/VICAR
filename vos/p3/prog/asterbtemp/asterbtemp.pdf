TAE PROCESS ASTERBTEMP
.HELP
PURPOSE:

   ASTERBTEMP is a program that accepts as input the five ASTER TIR channels
of Level 1B data (Channels 10-14), and outputs the corresponding brightness 
temperatures for each channel at each pixel.


OPERATION:

   ASTERBTEMP requires as input a 5 channel ASTER TIR image dataset of
Level 1B data.  The input should be the raw Level 1B pixel values, not
values converted into radiance units. An internal lookup table is used to
supply the converted output values.  As with the ASTER Level 2 Brightness
Temperature product, pixels of no data (such as the skew wedges) are converted
to -27315.  Invalid input pixel values are output as +29999.

   To interpret the output pixel values as temperature, divide by 100.0,
and read as degrees Celsius.  For example, a pixel value of 1234 should be
interpreted as 12.34 degrees Celsius.

   This program produces results that differ from the DAAC generated product
by 1 DN in approximately 20 percent of all pixels.  There is no apparent +/-
bias in the differences.  This discrepancy arises from the fact that the
DAAC lookup table is not coincident with the radiance values that result from
the Level 1B DN to radiance conversion factors, and no interpolation is done
to compensate for this fact. The built in lookup table for this program is a
direct Level 1B DN to Brightness Temperature DN table, so no compensation is
needed.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
ASTER TIR Level 1B image
.VARI OUT
Output dataset of the 5 ASTER
TIR bands, for brightness
temperature
.VARI SIZE
The standard  VICAR output size
field.
.VARI SL
Starting line
.VARI SS
Starting sample
.VARI NL
Number of lines
.VARI NS
Number of samples
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The input file should contain the 5 TIR channels of raw ASTER Level 1B data.
The pixel values should not have been converted into radiance units.
.VARI OUT
The output dataset will contain brightness temperature for each of the
5 input channels. 

Output pixels are halfword (16 bit signed integer), in units of degrees
Centigrade, scaled by a factor of 100.0

For example,

       DN = 2531  denotes a temperature of 25.31 degrees Celsius.
.VARI SIZE
The standard VICAR output size field.   Default will process the entire 
data set.
	Example: SIZE = (1,1,200,638)
.VARI SL
Starting line (same as SIZE(1)).
.VARI SS
Starting sample (same as SIZE(2)).
.VARI NL
Number of lines (same as SIZE(3)).
.VARI NS
Number of samples (same as SIZE(4)).
