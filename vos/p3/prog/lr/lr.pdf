     This program calculates the log residual values of the input data.
     The algorithm used is given in Roberts et al. 1985. Comparison 
     of various techniques for calibration of AIS data: Proc. Second 
     Airborne Imaging Spectrometer Data Analysis Workshop. May 6-8, 
     JPL Pub. 86-35, p.21-30.
     The maximum number of channels it will take is 250.
     the maximum number of pixels in a channels it will take is 1024.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
Ouput dataset 
.VARIABLE JSTART
Start channel 
.VARIABLE NCHAN
Number of channels
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
The output dataset is a BIL file with one more channel than the 
input. The additional channel is the log pixel mean which equates 
to the albedo.
.VARIABLE JSTART
The start channel within the dataset from which you want to start 
processing.
.VARIABLE NCHAN
The number of channels from the start channel that you want to process.
