.TITLE
Process EIGEN -- Principal component analysis using eigenvectors.
.HELP
PURPOSE:
        EIGEN will compute the principal component (aka the eigenvector or
Karhunen-Loeve) transformation matrix of up to 300 input channels.
The covariance (and, optionally, correlation) matrix, the transformation
matrix of eigen-vectors, and the eigen-values are printed, unless the user
requests otherwise.  If an output is provided, the principal component 
transformation is applied to the input image.

THEORY:

        The measure of inter-dimensional correlation in the multi-variate
system is usually defined by the covariance matrix of the multi-variate
data.  The linear transformation that diagonalizes the covariance matrix
can also be applied to the original data and produce a multi-variate
system with an inter-dimensional correlation of zero, i.e.; completely
uncorrelated multi-variate data.  The linear transformation that
accomplishes this is the matrix of eigen-vectors or characteristic vectors.

        A common application of this transformation is to reduce the
dimensionality of a multi-variate system.  The objective is to summarize
most of the variance, or information content, in a system with a
lessor number of 'artificial' variates, i.e.; principal components.
Effectively, by uncorrelating the system, we are compressing most of the
information into a system with lower dimensionality.

        Assume an n-variate system ( n channels of data ).  Let K be the
n x n covariance matrix of this data and A be the matrix of eigen-vectors
of K.  Associated with each eigen-vector A(j) there is an eigen-value or
characteristic root, e(j).

        Let A(j) = (a(1j),a(2j),...,a(nj)) be the eigen-vector corresponding
        to the jth largest eigen-value.

        Let X = (x(1),x(2),...,x(n)) be the n-variate observation
        ( n-dimensional pixel ).

        Then the jth principal component is: v(j) = A(j)  X = a(ij)x(i)

NOTE:  The jth eigen-value is actually the variance in the jth
principal component dimension.  Therefore, the eigen-values are useful
as a measure the information content that can be expected in the output
pictures.

OPERATION:

The input image is first statistically sampled, using the INC and AREA, 
parameters to select the sampling grid and region(s) of interest. The
user may choose to exclude all pixels that have a specified (by the 
parameter EXCLUDE) value in all input channels.  The channel by channel 
means and variances are computed, as well as the interchannel covariance 
(optionally, correlation) matrix.

From the calculated matrix, the related eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
computed. The matrix of these eigenvectors is often called the principal
component rotation matrix.

A "stretching vector" (or Normalization vector) is formed by taking the
reciprocal of the square root of each element of the eigenvalue vector,
and multiplying it by the SIGMA parameter. This has the effect of 
rescaling the output pixels in such a way that the standard deviation
of each output channel is equal to SIGMA.

Next, an offset value is computed for each output component. The offset
is seleceted to force the mean pixel value in each output channel to be
equal to the target value specified by the MEAN parameter.

Finally, if an output dataset has been provided, this transformation is
applied to the input dataset, and written to the output dataset.

The user may select a subset of the input bands to process, by using the
USEBANDS parameter.  Similarly, the user may save or use a subset of the
principal components, by using the OUTPUT_PCS parameter.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
input dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
(Optional) output dataset
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size
 field (sl,ss,nl,ns)
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE MATRIX
Use correlation or
covariance statistics?
(Valid: CORR, COV)
.VARIABLE INC
Compute statistics from every
nth line and nth sample
.VARIABLE USEBANDS
Use only these bands in the
calculation. (Default is to
use all bands.)
.VARIABLE OUTPUT_PCS
Restrict the output to the
following principal components.
(Default is to output all
components.)
.VARIABLE AREA
The subareas to be used to
compute statistics. Up to 50
regions (SL,SS,NL,NS) may be
entered. Default is to use
the entire image.
.VARIABLE MEAN
Desired image mean for each
output channel.
.VARIABLE SIGMA
Desired image standard deviation
for each output channel.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
Pixels with this DN in all
bands will be excluded from
all computations.
.VARIABLE PRINT
Determines the detail of the
printed information output
(Valid: ALL, SUMMARY, NOPRINT)
.VARIABLE XFORM_PARMS
The name for the parameter
dataset to hold the
transformation matrix.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Input is a single file in either BSQ or BIL format, containing at least 3 
channels.  The user may specify which channels are to be used, by means of 
the USEBANDS parameter.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT contains the name of the output dataset that contains the transformed
image.  If no output dataset is specified, the statistics will be gathered
and reported, but no transformation will be applied.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size field ( starting_line, starting_sample, 
number_of_lines, number_of_samples).
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line of the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample of the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines in the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples in the portion of the image that you wish to process.
.VARIABLE MATRIX
If the value of the parameter MATRIX is "COV" (the default), the image's
covariance matrix is used to determine the principal components.  If the
value of MATRIX is "CORR", then the correlation matrix is used instead.
.VARIABLE INC
Statistics are gathered using only every n'th line and n'th sample of the
image, or region of interest (AREA) within the image. The parameter INC
specifies the value on "n".
.VARIABLE USEBANDS
If this parameter is defaulted, all of the channels in the input file are
used in the transformation.  If the user wishes to use only a subset of 
the channels, the USEBANDS parameter is used to select the channels to be
used.
.VARIABLE OUTPUT_PCS
If this parameter is defaulted, the number of output components (channels)
will be equal to the number of input channels used.  If the user wishes
to output only a subset of the principal components, the OUTPUT_PCS
parameter is used to select the principal components to be output.
.VARIABLE AREA
Sets of (Starting_line, Starting_sample, Number_of_lines, Number_of_samples)
are given to define subareas used to generate the image statistics. 
Up to 50 set of subareas may be supplied.  The default is that the entire image 
is sampled.
.VARIABLE MEAN
A rescaling factor is included in the overall transformation to reposition the
output values in a range appropriate for output data type (BYTE, HALF, FULL,
REAL). The MEAN parameter specifies the desired mean value for the output 
image channels.  If MEAN is defaulted, a value of 127.5 is used.  If the AREA
parameter has been used, this target mean is for the AREA(s) of interest only.
To suppress rescaling entirely, assign the parameter SIGMA a negative value.
.VARIABLE SIGMA
A rescaling factor is included in the overall transformation to reposition the
output values in a range appropriate for the data output. The SIGMA parameter
specifies the desired standard deviation from the mean value in each of the 
output image channels.  If SIGMA is defaulted, then a value of 45.0 is used.
If SIGMA is assigned a negative value, the rescaling operation is suppressed.
If the AREA parameter has been used, this target standard deviation is for 
the AREA(s) of interest only.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
A pixel is excluded from use in determining the transformation if the
DN is equal to 'EXCLUDE' in each channel.
.VARIABLE PRINT
The value of the PRINT variable determines the detail of the printed 
information output to the standard output and session log.

If ALL (the default), the complete list of input means, standard deviations,
      interchannel covariances and correlations (if computed), eigenvalues,
      eigenvectors, and transformation equations is printed. 
If SUMMARY, these tables of values are only summarized, and the eigenvectors
      and transformation equations are omitted.
If NOPRINT, only the EIGEN version number is printed.
.VARIABLE XFORM_PARMS
If the XFORM_PARM parameter is given a value, the transformation matrix
will be saved as a VICAR parameter dataset, and have the dataset name
specified by the save parameter. This parameter dataset may then be included
in the parameters for XFORM, to repeat this transformation on other datasets.
