1  MOMATI

     To compute the planet to spacecraft rotation matrix (OM) and
     displacement vector (RS) in the MAP2 far encounter mode.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE:

     CALL MOMATI(LO,SO,LSS,SSS,SCALE,FL,SSLON,SSLAT,NA,RANGE,OM,RS)

2  ARGUMENTS:

     LO       Optical axis line        object space pixels
     SO       Optical axis sample      object space pixels
     LSS      Sub spacecraft point     object space line
     SSS      Sub spacecraft point     object space sample
     SCALE    Picture scale            object space pixels/mm.
     FL       Focal length             mm.
     SSLON    Sub spacecraft point     longitude, degrees west
     SSLAT    Sub spacecraft point     geocentric latitude, degrees
     NA       North angle, degrees clockwise from up of spin axis
     RANGE    Distance planet center to spacecraft, mm.
     OM       OM matrix                9 elements
     RS       RS vector                3 elements

     All arguments must be in REAL*8 format.  The OM matrix and 
     RS vector are computed and returned by the program.  All
     other arguments are inputs to the program.

     Restrictions:

     Subroutines called:  ZIA, DCOS, DSIN, DSQRT

     Core requirements:  2540 bytes


2  OPERATION

     The program differs from the subroutine MOMATV only in the 
     definition of the north angle.  This subroutine uses a north
     angle which is consistent with the north angle currently
     available in the Voyager SEDR.

     Revision: 1, 10 September 1980

     Revision Summary:

     This revision corrects for an error in the original documentation.
     The arguments SSLON and SSLAT are inverted.  No change has been
     made to the program itself.
