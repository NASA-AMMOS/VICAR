1 MIPS VICAR routine SEARCV3

  ***

  THIS ROUTINE SHOULD NEVER BE CALLED DIRECTLY BY AN APPLICATION PROGRAM.  

  ***

  It is used by the map label readers to process IBM (old-style)
  map projection labels.

2 Calling Sequence

  CALL SEARCV3( UNIT, DATA, DATA, STATUS)

  Arguments: UNIT   - input I*4 - unit of file to be searched
             DATA   - output *4 (40) - MAP data buffer
             STATUS - output I*4 - status code
2 History

  Original Programmer: 		L.W.Kamp
  Current Cognizant Programmer: L.W.Kamp
  Date written:			18 September 1993 (based on SEARCV2)
  Source Language: 		FORTRAN
  Revisions:			

  16feb94 -lwk- fixed bug getting SCALE in simple cylindrical

  December 1994	JFM: ERR_ACT option of blanks (ZVEACTION override)
  added to VICARL RTL routines used in SEARVC3.  This was done make the
  MP_ROUTINES software immune to application programs using ZVEACTION.
  (FR 85665)

  March 1995 JFM:  Added retrieval of map resolution in pixels per degree,
  array element 10.  This is retrieved for the following projections:
  Mercator (#6), Transverse Mercator (#15), Cylindrical Equal-Area (Normal)
  (#9), and Simple Cylindrical (#10).

  04apr95 -lwk- fixed "Instances" in xlhinfo/xlget calls

  26 April 1995 FFM:  Initialize nc to 0 if status = -38 from XLGET;
  Initialize bufsize to 0.  The initializations are needed for ANDES 
  platform (FR 85609).

2 Operation

	SEARCV3 will search a picture label and return a buffer
	containing MAP3 projection parameters or whether the 
	picture is raw or geometrically corrected.  The returned
	buffer is compatible with conventions for the MAP and
	CONVEV subroutines.

	Only DATA(39) will be modified if the image is not a
	map-projection, ie: has no map2 labels.

	The file must be opened prior to calling SEARCV3.

	The following label words imply an object space
	(geometrically corrected) image:  GEOMA, MGEOM, GEOM
	GEOMAR, FARENC,FARENCX, FARENCY, FARENCZ.
	
	If the label contains the radii of the planet, that will
	be stored in the data buffer as words 25 and 26.

2 Arguments

  UNIT - INTEGER*4 -     This is the unit of the file whose label is to 
                         be searched for MAP3 labels
  DUM  - not used
  WORK   not used

  DATA -INTEGER*4(40) -  This is the standard MAP data buffer.  
                         Values derived from the label are returned here.
                         It is input twice because some items are real 
                         and some are integer.  Note that map resolution
			 (element 10) is only available for the following
			 projections: MERCATOR, TRANSVERSE MERCATOR, 
			 CYLINDRICAL EQUAL AREA, and SIMPLE CYLINDRICAL.

  Normally the following is returned in DATA:

	DATA(1) = SPECIAL SAMPLE POINT             R*4
	DATA(2) = SPECIAL LINE POINT               R*4
	DATA(3) = SPECIAL LATITUDE POINT           R*4
	DATA(4) = LATITUDE OF SPEC PARALLEL (DEG)  R*4
	DATA(5) = LATITUDE OF SPEC PARALLEL  (DEG) R*4
	DATA(6) = SPECIAL LONGITUDE (WEST) (DEG)   R*4
	DATA(7) = SCALE (KILOMETERS/PIXEL)         R*4
	DATA(8) = VISIBLE POLE  1=N -1=S           R*4
	DATA(9) = NORTH ANGLE                      R*4
	DATA(10)= RESOLUTION (PIXELS/DEGREE)	   R*4
	DATA(25)= POLAR RADIUS (KM)                R*4
	DATA(26)= EQUATORIAL RADIUS (KM)           R*4
	DATA(39)= PROJECTION TYPE                  I*4
			1=POLAR ORTHOGRAPHIC
			2=OBLIQUE    "
			3=POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC
			4=OBLIQUE    "
			5=LAMBERT
			6=MERCATOR
			7=RAW UNCORRECTED IMAGE
			8=GEOMETRICALLY CORRECTED IMAGE
			9=NORMAL CYLINDRICAL
		       10=SIMPLE     "
                       11=OBLIQUE SIMPLE CYLINDRICAL
                       12=SINUSOIDAL
                       13=OBLIQUE SINUSOIDAL
                       14=MOLLWEIDE
                       15=TRANSVERSE MERCATOR
                       16=PERSPECTIVE

  For the case when the projection type is #16 then DATA contains:

       DATA(1-18)=OM matrix*             Real*8
       DATA(19-24)=RS vector*            Real*8
       DATA(31)=s/c latitude             Real*4
       DATA(32)=s/c longitude            Real*4
       DATA(33)=line                     Real*4
       DATA(34)=sample                   Real*4
       DATA(38)=Range to target body     Real*4
       DATA(27)=focallength              Real*4
       DATA(30)=scale in pixels/mm.      Real*4
       DATA(35)=North angle              Real*4
       DATA(28)=optical axis line        Real*4
       DATA(29)=optical axis sample      Real*4
       DATA(39)=16

  * NOTE: PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION OF "DATA" ARRAY FOR PASSING
	  DOUBLE PRECISION VALUES (REAL*8) IN ELEMENTS OF A REAL
	  (REAL*4) ARRAY IS NOT PORTABLE.  ONLY ON THE VAX/VMS
	  SYSTEM (unported system) WILL THE VALUES OF THE OM MATRIX 
 	  AND RS VECTOR BE CORRECT.

  For the case when the projection type is #7 then DATA contains:

       DATA(39)=7    only (image space). You must call the SPICE/SEDR yourself

  For the case when the projection type is #8 then DATA contains:

       DATA(39)=8    only (object space). You must call the SPICE/SEDR yourself
