1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mpLabelWrite

PURPOSE

The function mpLabelWrite writes map projection property 
and history labels of VICAR images using the information 
stored in the map projection data object.

2 OPERATION

This function takes as input a VICAR file unit number and 
a pointer to the map projection data object and writes 
appropriate values to the MAP property or history label
of the VICAR image file.

When a map projection value is not present in the data object, 
the associated value in the label is not written. 
The description of the map projection (MAP_PROJECTION_DESC) 
is predefined text which is written to the label based on the 
map projection type stored in the data object. The label values 
MAXIMUM_LATITUDE, MAXIMUM_LONGITUDE, MINIMUM_LATITUDE, 
MINIMUM_LONGITUDE are calculated and written when they are 
appropriate for the image (e.g. if the pole is visible in the 
image, these values will not be calculated.)

CALLING SEQUENCE

from C:		status = mpLabelWrite( MP mp, int file_unit,
					char label_type );
from FORTRAN:	call mp_label_write( mp, file_unit, label_type )

Necessary include files from calling routine or program: 
		mp_routines.h or mp_for_defs.fin


INPUT 

mp		(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned by mpInit.
In FORTRAN, this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type is defined
in include file mp_routines.h.

file_unit	(integer)

VICAR file unit number as returned by x/zvunit().

label_type	(character array)

Specifies whether the label is written as a VICAR history or property
label.  Valid values are "HISTORY" and "PROPERTY".


RETURN

status 		(integer)

Status flag for the operation of the routine. 
Zero (0) signifies success. Negative one (-1) 
signifies failure.
