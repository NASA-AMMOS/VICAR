The notes below are ordered by software release dates to the MIPS Development 
System.  Note that not all versions are delivered to the MIPS Operational 
System.  Versions that are delivered to the MIPS Operational System have a 
delivery number, subsystem name, and version number placed in parentheses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Original version (Delivery 12.0, MGEN V28.7)

	Initial release on November 16, 1993.


Version December 1993 (Delivery 12.0, MGEN V30.2)

	1) 	A few lines in the mpSphere function's sinusoidal projection
		arithmetic were corrected to avoid access violations.
	2)	MP routines global flags changed to mpSUCCESS and 
		mpFAILURE in the mp.h include file.  All references to FAILURE 
		and SUCCESS changed to mpFAILURE and mpSUCCESS, respectively.
	3)	Function mpInit was modified to initialize all MP data object 
		values for added robustness.

	Failure reports closed in this version: 76817.


Version May 1994

	1)	Revised include file mp.h to add a define constant for success 
		status for VICAR RTL calls.  Portions of MP source code revised
 		to use this new define constant.
	2)	Added FORTRAN language bridge mp_get_keywords to the file
		mpgetkeywords.c.
	3)	Added FORTRAN test program tmp_routines_f to testing procedure.
	4)	Made NORMAL_CYLINDRICAL and CYLINDRICAL_EQUAL_AREA equivalent
		projections in the function determine_map_projection_number.
	5)	Corrected help file (.hlp) of mpLabelWrite.
	6)	Created a new public member function mpSetDebugFlag to handle
		automatically the setting of the internal debug flag mp_debug.
		This resolved the issue of FORTRAN language handling of 
		mp_debug.
	7)	LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET and SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET
		handling was corrected to add +1 to these values in mpMpo2Buf 
		and -1 to these values in mpBuf2Mpo.
	8)	Changed "REAL" to "DOUB" in calls to zlget in mpLabelRead and
		zladd in mpLabelWrite.
	9)	Changed the max_length argument of sc2for in mp_get_value_str 
		to a value of zero.
	10)	Added BODY_LONG_AXIS as a part of the global structure within 
		the larger MP data object structure in the include file 
		mp_private.h.
	11)	Function prototypes file mp_prototypes.h formalized and MP 
		routines compiled now with the USES_ANSI_C option 
		(see mp_routines.imake).

	Failure reports fixed in this version: 76820, 82916, 83089.


Version June 1994

	1)	Corrected help file (.hlp)  Originally, the help file
		was missing the argument label_type in the sample calling
		sequence and in the argument descriptions.
	2)	Moved all dependencies on the NAIF SPICE library to the
		file mppconstants.c.  This allows programs which do not call
		mpPConstants to link to the MP routines without dependence on
		the SPICE library.
	3)	Tests for function call success or failure were corrected in 
		the following functions: mpLabelRead, mpLabelWrite.  
		Previously, mpLabelWrite and mpLabelRead would fail on 
		correct input.
	4)	Corrected the .imake file for the FORTRAN test program
		tmp_routines_f.  A define for FTNINC_LIST was added to 
		reference mp_for_defs.  Also, the source code line in 
		tmp_routines_f was revised to remove .fin file extension.
	5)	FORTRAN function dsimq of function ztricoef renamed to
		mp_dsimq to avoid symbol conflicts in the P2 sublib on 
		the UNIX machines.
	6)	Added C test program tmp_label to test label reading and 
		writing functions.
	
	Failure reports fixed in this version: 85074, 85078.


Version July 1994

	1)	Simplified FORTRAN routines mp_set_value, mp_set_value_str,
		mp_get_value, mp_get_value_str to first complete FORTRAN
		to C variable conversions and then call the C routines
		mpSetValues and mpGetValues, respectively.
	2) 	mpLabelWrite revised to return mpSUCCESS instead of the
		local variable status as the routine's status flag.
	3)	Incorporated BODY_LONG_AXIS keyword handling into the
		routines mpSetValues and mpGetValues.
	
	Failure reports fixed in this version: 85068, 85090.
	Failure reports for which work is related: 85186.


Version October 1994

	1) 	Released a renamed, duplicate version of mp.h called
		mp_routines.h.  This was released to initiate the 
		process of obsoleting mp.h, which conflicts with
		a system level include file on the UNIX platforms.
	2) 	Include of file "mp_init.h" moved from mpgetkeywords.c
		to mpinit.c.  This avoids a possible uninitialized mp
		data object.
	3)	Euler and Cartesian rotation calculations corrected.
	4)	Inverse mode of Sinusoidal projection corrected.
	5)	Projection descriptions added for all projections.
	6) 	Longitude range checking within formulae revised to
		add or subtract multiples of 360 degrees instead of
		returning failure status values.
	7) 	Mercator and sinusoidal projections for spherical model
		compared successfully against TRANV and hand calculations.

	Failure reports fixed in this version: 82922, 85093, 85094, 
					       85645, 85668.

Version December 1994

	1) 	Cylindrical Equal Area and Equidistant Cylindrical projections
		corrected and verified for spherical body model.
	2) 	Test programs revised to reference mp_routines.h and to use
		ANSI C.
	3) 	mpLabelRead, mpLabelWrite both revised to override error
		handling action used by application programs through ZVEACTION.

	Failure reports fixed in this version: 85665


Version January 1995

	1) 	Corrected calls to zvfilename in test programs.
	2)	Changed call to momati to zmomati in mpMpo2buf.c.

	Failure reports fixed in this version: 85699


Version February 1995

	1)	Updated mp_for_defs.fin to contain all defines that
		are within mp_routines.h.
	2)	Corrected interpretation of Cylindrical Equal Area and
		Simple Cylindrical projection information (added setting
		of FIRST_STANDARD_PARALLEL keywords).
	3)	Map projection descriptions were revised to include a 
		statement about latitude type.

	Failure reports fixed in this version: 85700


Version March 1995

	1) 	Changed mapping in mpBuf2Mpo of Cylindrical Equal-Area
		projection such that XC or SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is
		set to 0.0; this required modification of cases in the
		switch statement for most all map projections.  Code
		was modified to use one mail switch statement and return
		status flag set to variable status.  Also, mpBuf2Mpo
		revised to handle the return of map resolution value
		for projections MERCATOR, TRANSVERSE MERCATOR, 
		CYLINDRICAL EQUAL AREA, and SIMPLE CYLINDRICAL, per
		changes to SEARCV3.
	2)	Return status flag checks revised within and after calls
		to mpSphere, mpOblate, and mpEllipsoid for modules 
		mpll2xy and mpxy2ll.  These modifications made to ensure
		lower level error status flags are passed properly to
		the calling program and not simply mapped to mpFAILURE.
	3) 	Corrected argument values passed into ZMOMATI within
		mpMpo2Buf.

	Failure reports fixed in this version: 85803, 85805


Version September 1995

        1)      Modified how function handles model set testing within
		mpxy2ll and mpll2xy in order to allow multiple data
		objects within one application. 
	2)	Revised mp.h to have MAX define in an identical syntax
		to Motif include file's MAX define.

	Failure report fixed in this verion: 87378, 87358 

Version December 1995
	(These changes made by Prabhu Ambatipudi)

	1) 	Corrected Lambert Azimuthal Equal-area projection and
		included unit test of spherical case in test pdf.

	2) 	Added projection formulae numbers from USGS manual
		to MAP_DESC keyword so that users can have a direct
		trace back to mathematics behind the projections.
		Note that USGS Professional Paper 1395, second
		printing 1989 was used as a reference.

	3) 	Revised mp.h and mp_routines.h to include statements
		#ifndef MP_ROUTINES_H, #define MP_ROUTINES_H, and #endif.

	4) 	Revised the implementation of equidistant cylindrical to
		be available for nonspherical bodies, and removed oblique
		simple cylindrical support due to a revision of how the simple
		cylindrical CENTER_LATITUDE and CENTER_LONGITUDE values
		are handled.
	
	Failure reports fixed in this version: 87367, 85758

Version June 1996
	(These changes made by Prabhu Ambatipudi)

	1)	Corrected spherical model formulae for the following 
		projections : Lambert Conformal Conic (both one and two
		parallel cases), Albers Equal Area (one and two parallels
		cases), and Orthographic. Verified line,sample output based
		on input latitudes/longitudes for these projections in 
		testpdf.

	2) 	Included unit tests of spherical case for each projection
		listed above in the main tstmp_routines testpdf.

	3)	Changed the number of precalc_values limit to 6. Changes
		were made in mpinit.c and mp_private.h to accomplish this.

	4) 	Made the Oblique Simple Cylindrical projection case a part
		of the map description set, in mpinternals.c

	5) 	Corrected errors relating to the inclusion of 'PROPERTY' 
		label in functionality of mplabelwrite.

	6)	Included 'FTN_STRING' parameter as part of the mp_routines
		imake file list.  

	7)	Put in calls to 'check_longitude_radians' before references
		to the use of *longitude, in line,sample calculations for
		the projections Mercator, Mollweide, Cylindrical Equal Area.

	8) 	Added in keywords related to perspective projection in all
		relevant files, and added cases of perspective projection
		options in mpinternals.c

	9) 	Implemented functionality of triaxial ellipsoid model for
		authalic projections. This includes reincorporating the
		file 'mp_internals.f' to now contain relevant code for
		authalic auxillary coefficient generation, as well as
		conformal. Also put in appropriate code changes for calls
		to 'triaxcoef' routines, and C-Fortran Bridge interfaces.

	10)	Implemented test case for sinusoidal projection for 
		triaxial ellipsoid case , in the main testpdf.

	11)	Changed the initial value setting for center_latitude and
		center_longitude, in 'mpinit.c' to -999.0 instead of 0.
		This is in case of user not setting these values, but not
		wanting default to zero.

	12)	Assigned B_AXIS_RADIUS parameter to mpSetValues call and
		mpGetValues call in mpbuf2mpo.c and mpmpo2buf.c respectively.
		This inorder to assign it to a buffer value for use in
		call to perspective projection (persp_proj.f)
	           
	13)	Added perspective projection related keywords to pdf_parms
		and pds_keys list, in files tmp_forward.c, tmp_routines.c,
		tmp_routines_verbose.c

	14)	Modified 'ztriaxcoef' call prototype definition in file  
		mp_prototypes.h, to deal with added argument list.
		Added call definition for zpproj_mp() in same file, for
		perspective projection.

	15)	Changed the definition of auxillary lat/lon term 'J'(NLIMIT) 
		in file mpinternals.c. This change is needed in order for 
		computational compatability with 'tricoef' program parameters.
		Also, introduced the term 'K' to define KLIMIT, needed for
		authalic auxillary lat/lon coefficient computation.

	16)	Included code to take care of oblate spheroid and triaxial
		ellipsoid cases of perspective projection, by routing them
		to mpSphere. Perspective is non-conformal/authalic.

	17)	Added C-Fortran bridge for routine zpproj_mp().

	18)	Incorporated program 'persp_proj.f' filename into the module
		list of mp_routines.imake. This contains the routine
		zpproj_mp(), the perspective projection implemented adopted
		from program written by Lucas Kamp.

	19)	Included 'LIB_SPICE' define in tmp_label.imake, to account
		for call to spice library functions in zpproj_mp().

	20)	Updated 'tmp_routines.pdf' to account for perspective 
		projection keywords.

	21)	Implemented functionality of triaxial ellipsoid for authalic
		projections.

	22)	Modified parameter assignment for variables in file 
		'mp_internals.f' (tricoef routine), and changed declaration
		of 'ran1' variable to real*4, based on changes made by J.Lorre
	
	Failure reports fixed in this version: 89294,82967,85758,89152,88207
	Electronic failure reports from DLR Germany addressed in this
		version: D00104,D00024,D00001	

Version July 1996
	(These changes made by Prabhu Ambatipudi)

	23)	For build#16.1, incorporated changes Jean Lorre made in 
		'tricoef.com', into mp_internals.f. These affected the 
		random number generation which in turn affected auxillary
		coefficient generation.

	24) 	Removed naif/spice dependencies in mp_routines, specifically
		as related to persp_proj.f. All naif dependent routine calls
		were replaced with relevant in-line code, for perspective
		projection. 	

Version August 1996
	(These changes made by Prabhu Ambatipudi)

	25) 	Again modified/added code in mp_internals.f, to correct
		problem with tricoef routine on sgi machine. The randum
		number generator had to be changed; changes made by Jean
		Lorre incorporated.

	26)	BODY_LONG_AXIS parameter implementation included with this
		delivery. Thorough testing not complete as of yet, but
		sample test case with it assigned in the parameter list is
		included in tstmp_routines.pdf

	27)	In persp_proj.f, input line/sample when both are positive
		in mpinternals, was being input as negative to this program.
		Thus value of line negated after call to Cartestian_
		translation routine in mpinternals.
   
	This delivery did not address any specific FR numbers, but had to
	be delivered to accomodate other programs dependent on mp_routines.

        28)	Redelivered module with a fix to DLR electronic FR D00113
		The 'addressing' of authalic_latitude and authalic_longitude
		were removed from call to ztriaxtran in reverse calculation
		portion (LINE_SAMPLE_TO_LAT_LON) of authalic projections
		case in 'mpEllipsoid', to correct a format number problem
		occurring in triaxtran.com interface.

	29)	Added another test case for stereographic projection  
		(conformal example) and triaxial body model. Also changed
		test case program from 'tmp_forward' to 'tmp_routines' for
		triaxial test case dealing with sinusoidal projection. 

Version October 1996
	(These changes were made by Lucas Kamp and Frank Scholten)

	1) 	The new keyword COORDINATE_SYSTEM_NAME was added to the 
		Global group.

	2)	+1 was added to L/S offsets in Cartesian transformations.

	3)	Ensure that CHECKif does not replace an MP error 
		(status < -1000) with simple failure to project (status = -1).

	4) 	For perspective projection, replaced map_scale by appropriate 
		formula in mpinternals.c.  (Note:  an alternative would be 
		to add map_scale to the Global group).  Also: changed E.lon 
		to West before calling PPROJ;  return immediately when PPROJ 
		returns 1;  don't call perform_precalcs for this case;
		removed confusing comments and commented-out code pertaining
		to USGS "Vertical Perspective" equations;  added reference to 
		mpGetDesc for this case 

	5)	Albers:  fixed algorithm when n<0

	6)	Lambert:  fixed algorithm when n<0 and at Poles;
		(two_par only:) fixed problem in longitude -> sample 
		computation.

	7)	Enforced check on longitude range (-180 -> 180) in inverse mode
		for several projections.

	8)	Added Orthographic projection to mpOblate using ORTHO_OBL.F,
		revised mpGetDesc accordingly

	9)	Fixes to Orthographic & Stereographic for rho=0 and in 
		checking limits

	10)	Fixed errors in precalcs for Lambert one_par and in
		planetodetic_authalic_trans

Version November 1996
	(These changes made by Prabhu Ambatipudi)

	1)	Added three more tests in the main tstpdf (tstmp_routines.pdf)
		that deal with oblate spheroid testing. The projections 
                tested in tests 24,25,and 26 are Cylindrical Equal Area,
		Lambert Azimuthal equal area, and Stereographic. Values used
 		in testing obtained from USGS Snyder manual.
	  
	2)	Modified mpSetValues call in mppconstants.c , for parameter
		LONG_AXIS, to value[0], to read in the proper value from
		the SPICE kernel file. 

Version March 1997
	(Changes were made by Frank Scholten and implemented by Lucas Kamp)

	1)  mp_load_EULER_rotation_matrix was revised to use the auxiliary
	    (authalic/conformal) latitude instead of planetodetic.

	2)  code was added to load_coefficients to calculate 
	    precalc.oblate_value's.

	3)  mpMAX_DESCRIPTION_LINES was increased from 20 to 30, to allow
	    for the LAMBERT_AZIMUTHAL case.

	4)  checks for latitudes very close to 90 degrees were added to
	    mpMpo2Buf and to ORTHO_OBL.

	5)  ERR_ACT was disabled in the zlget calls to History in mpLabelRead.

	6)  COORDINATE_SYSTEM_NAME = PLANETODETIC was made the default in
	    mpLabelRead.

Version September 1997
	(Changes were made by Bob Deen)

	1)  Changed FORTRAN calling standard for the MP object to be
	    REAL*8 instead of just INTEGER.  This was necessary for
	    compatibility with 64-bit operating systems, because the MP
	    object ID is used internally as a pointer.  Only 4 bytes
	    are used on 32-bit systems, but since FORTRAN has no typedef
	    capability, all must use REAL*8.

Version March 1997
	(Changes were made by Frank Scholten and Lucas Kamp)

	1)  Corrected transformation_direction in mp_load_Euler...
	    before conformat/authalic transformation

	2)  Added a check for longitude range to code for Mollweide
	    in mpSphere

	3)  Changed SPACECRAFT_DISTANCE to TARGET_CENTER_DISTANCE,
	    added MINIMUM/MAXIMUM LATITUDE/LONGITUDE

Version June 1997
	(Changes were made by Lucas Kamp and Bob Deen)

	1)  Replaced function RANGEN() in triaxcoef() with RAN1(), because
	    it caused problems on DEC Unix systems.  RAN1 was modified to
	    fix previous problems encountered on the SGI.

	2)  Initialized buffer in mplabelread().

	3)  Removed ztime() from prototypes and mp_time() from mpinternals,
	    as neither is used anywhere.

	4)  Fixed bug in mpSphere for Stereographic case when rho=0.0.

	6)  Fixed planetodetic case for Equidistant Cylindrical.

	7)  Replaced Galileo-specific SPICE call zbodn2c_g (with zbodn2c).

	8)  Suppressed messages from triaxcoef() unless the debug flag
	    is specified.

	9)  Changed prototypes for use with C++;  changed mpGetKeywords
	    calling sequence in consequence.

Version Sept. 1998
	(Changes made by Matt McNeely))

	Moved mppconstants.c from mp_routines.com to mp_pconstants.com, to 
	eliminate SPICE dependencies;  mp_routines.com moved to P1 while
	mp_pconstants.com remained in P2

Version Nov. - Dec. 1999

	(Changes made by Thomas Roatsch:)

	1. mp_routines.com was broken into three parts:
	 - mp_routines contains only the routines which are necessary for
	  the mp initialization and calculations
	 - mp_labels contains the label I/O routines and mpbuf2mpo.c
	  (but mpmpo2buf.c is still in mp_routines, because it is called
	  in mpinternals);  this com-file also contains all test scripts,
	  docs, etc.
	 - mp_bridges contains the Fortran bridges to the C-routines
	  (both in mp_routines and mp_labels)

	2. call abend in mp_internals was changed to status -401,-402, -403

	3. The statement:	
	 #define mpMAX_DESCRIPTION_LINES 30
	was moved from mp_private to mp_routines

	4. The unused routines copy_coef and zget_ellipsoid were removed.

	5. Code was added to mpsetvalues to automatically compute
	map_scale and map_resolution from each other.

	(Changes made by Lucas Kamp:)

	6. mpgetvalues was revised to remove code supplying scale or
	resolution if only the other was supplied

	7. tstmp_routines.pdf was revised to be consistent with change #5

	8. tmp_buf2mpo was added to test procedure

	9. mpbuf2mpo was revised to remove call to set map_resolution, as
	this was causing an error for some projections due to above changes

	10. some synonyms for projection names were added to mpmpo2buf


Version July 2000
	(Changes were made by Lucas Kamp)

	1. "target_body", which is not a PDS standard, was changed to 
	"target_name" in all instances (both internally in the code and 
	in the external interface), but target_body was retained as an 
	alias for target_name, for compatibility with old versions.  
	This required changes to mpgetvalues.c, mpsetvalues.c, mp_init.h, 
	and mp_private.h (all in mp_routines.com), mpgetpar.com, 
	mp_routines.h, and mp_for_defs.fin.

	2. "planetodetic", which is not a PDS standard, was changed to 
	"planetographic" in the external interface (only), and code was 
	added to mpgetvalues.c to check to ensure that the values of 
	coordinate_system_name are valid, and to change the value
	"planetodetic" (which is still acceptable as an alias) to 
	"planetographic".

	3. Code was added to mpgetvalues.c to check to ensure that the 
	values of positive_longitude_direction are valid (East/West).
	A new error code, mpINVALID_LONG_DIRECTION, was added to 
	mp_routines.h to be used there.

	4. Code was added to mpll2xy.c and mpxy2ll.c to check that the
	variable defining the coordinate system falls in the valid range.
	A new error code (mpINVALID_COORD_SYSTEM) was added to 
	mp_routines.h to be used there and in mpgetvalues.c.

	5. In mp_internals.f, the common block named c1 was changed to
	triaxcoef_common, to avoid conflicts with other Vicar subroutine 
	common blocks on the Solaris (after upgrade to a new compiler?).
	Code was also added to initialize this common block and to save
	variables in the function ran1() called there, in order to fix 
	problems encountered on the SGI.


Version October 2000
	(Changes were made by Lucas Kamp)

	mpll2xy and mpxy2ll were revised so as not to transform between
	planetographic and planetocentric coordinates for the case of
	Equidistant projections, since the equations for this case are 
	independent of those systems.

Version July 2001

	1. (Change made by Thomas Roatsch)
	Replaced all remaining Fortran code by C.

	(Changes made by Lucas Kamp:)

	2. Fixed a bug in persp_proj_c.c (had been in persp_proj.f since
	1996).

	3. Added back switch mp_debug and related code (except in triaxtran),
	removed sub 1.

	4. Removed spurious check that A/B/C radii must be in descending
	order from triaxcoef (& added a test of this to tst_mp....pdf)

	5. Forced output coordinate_system_name to be planetodetic 
	instead of -graphic in mpgetvalues, per change of July 2000.  
	(This had been reversed sub 1.)
