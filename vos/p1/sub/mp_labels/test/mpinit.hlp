1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mpInit

PURPOSE
The function mpInit allocates memory for a map
projection (MP) data object to be used for subsequent
processing with other MP functions.

2 OPERATION

This function allocates memory for a specified 
MP data object using the C function malloc()
and initializes certain control variables and other
values in the data object. This function must be
called prior to the use of any other MP functions.

CALLING SEQUENCE:		

from C		status = mpInit( MP *mp );
from FORTRAN	call mp_init( mp,status ) 

Necessary include files
from calling routine 
or program:			mp_routines.h

INPUT

mp 		(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned by mpInit. 
In FORTRAN, this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type is 
defined in the include file mp_routines.h

RETURN

status		(integer)

Indicator of success or failure of the routine. Zero indicates
success and -1 failure. From FORTRAN, status is returned as an
argument of the function.
