1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mpFree

PURPOSE
The function mpFree deallocates memory reserved for 
a map projection data object by mpInit.

2 OPERATION

This function deallocates memory for a specified 
map projection data object using the C function free().
This function should be called once an application
program has completed work with all MP functions.

CALLING SEQUENCE:		

from C		status = mpFree( MP mp );
from FORTRAN	call mp_free( mp ) 

Necessary include files
from calling routine 
or program:			mp_routines.h

INPUT

mp 		(MP type as defined in include file mp_routines.h)

Variable for the address of the map projection data object
as returned by mpInit.

OUTPUT

status		(int)

Returns mpSUCCESS, the value 0.
