1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mpSetValues

PURPOSE

The function mpSetValues accepts values of any data type 
for specific map projection keyword values and sets them 
in the map projection (MP) data object.

2 OPERATION

This function allows controlled access to the modification 
of MP data object values. Every call to this function causes 
the MP software to recalculate all possible precalculated 
values used for a specific map projection.  The function only
sets values which are valid for a particular projection.

CALLING SEQUENCE

from C:	status = mpSetValues( MP mp, char *keyword, 
  		<any-type> *value ... char *keyword, 
		<any-type> *value, NULL )

from FORTRAN:	(see functions mp_set_value and mp_set_value_str)

Necessary include files from calling routine or program: mp_routines.h


INPUT 

mp		(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned by mpInit. In FORTRAN,
this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type is defined in include file
mp_routines.h.

keyword		(character string)

Character string which contains the keyword name of the MP data object
value to be set.

value 		(any type)

Value to be stored for the associated map projection 
keyword in the MP data object.


RETURN

status 		(integer)

Status flag for the operation of the routine. 
Zero (0) signifies success and -1 failure.
