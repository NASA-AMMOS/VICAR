1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mp_get_value

PURPOSE

The function mp_get_value retrieves double precision numerical values
from the map projection data object from FORTRAN application programs.

2 OPERATION

This function allows controlled access to map projection data object 
double precision numerical values. 


CALLING SEQUENCE

from C:		(see mpGetValues)

from FORTRAN:	call mp_get_value( mp, keyword, value, status )

Necessary include files from calling routine or program: mp_for_defs.fin


INPUT 

mp		(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned by mpInit. In FORTRAN, 
this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type is defined in include file
mp_routines.h.

keyword		(character string)

Character string which contains the keyword name of the MP data object
value to be retrieved.

OUTPUT

value 		(double)

Double precision value to be retrieved from the MP data object.

status 		(integer)

Status flag for the operation of the routine. Zero (0) signifies
success.  Negative one (-1) signifies failure.


3 ENVIRONMENT
