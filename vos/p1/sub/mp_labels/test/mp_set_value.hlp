1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mp_set_value

PURPOSE

The function mp_set_value accepts double precision numerical values
for insertion in the map projection (MP) data object for a specific map 
projection keyword value from FORTRAN application programs.

2 OPERATION

This function allows controlled access to MP data object double
precision values.

CALLING SEQUENCE

from C:		(see mpSetValues)

from FORTRAN:	call mp_set_value( mp, keyword, value, status )

Necessary include files from calling routine or program: mp_for_defs.fin


INPUT 

mp		(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned by mpInit.  In FORTRAN,
this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type is defined in include file
mp_routines.h.

keyword		(character string)

Character string which contains the keyword name of the MP data object
value to be set.

value 		(double)

Double precision numerical value to be stored for the associated map 
projection keyword in the MP data object.


OUTPUT

status 		(integer)

Status flag for the operation of the routine. Zero (0) signifies
success.  Negative one (-1) signifies failure.
