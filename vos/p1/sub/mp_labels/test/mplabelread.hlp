1 MIPS SUBROUTINE mpLabelRead

PURPOSE

The function mpLabelRead reads map projection property labels
of VICAR images and loads an existing map projection data object
with values from the label.

2 OPERATION

This function takes as input a VICAR image file unit number and
the address of a map projection data object and fills the data object
with information from the map projection (MAP) property label. This
function calls mpSetValues to load the data object. 


CALLING SEQUENCE

from C:		status = mpLabelRead( MP *mp, int file_unit );
from FORTRAN:	call mp_label_read( mp,file_unit,status )

INPUT 

file_unit	(integer)

VICAR file unit number as returned by x/zvunit().

mp		(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned by mpInit. 
In FORTRAN, this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type is defined
in include file mp_routines.h.

RETURN

status 		(integer)

Status flag for the operation of the routine.
Zero (0) signifies success and -1 failure.
