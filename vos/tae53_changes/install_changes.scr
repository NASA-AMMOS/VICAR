# Mac OS X (or at least its HFS+ file system) is only sort-of case sensitive.
# The softlink of e.g. PGMINC.FIN to pgminc.fin is problematic; they appear to
# be the same file.  A tar transfer can pick up the symlink instead of the
# file; the symlink then appears to point to itself.  So, we simply make a
# copy instead of a link.  This way, no matter which one is actually picked
# up, we get a valid file.  This should not hurt other platforms as long as
# the two are kept in sync (which should not be a problem since this copy is
# made during the build).
# For the Mac itself, the tar might have given us just the upper-case version.
# So we do some shuffling around to make sure the lower-case one is there.
# Because some Mac file systems are normal, we also copy back to the upper-case
# one, just in case.
