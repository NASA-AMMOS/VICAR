/**/ #
/**/ #	clib.a - source for the c bridge library
/**/ #
/**/ #	This library actually consists of a single
/**/ #	object module 'cmput.o' which must be included by the
/**/ #	C application programs before the TAE library lib.a,
/**/ # 	to replace the module p_mput in that library. The lib.a 
/**/ #	version of p_mput is refenced by FORTRAN application
/**/ #	programs and it invokes other modules that need routines
/**/ #	from the system FORTRAN library. 
/**/ #
/**/ #	NOTE: clib.a is a copy of cmput.o. We ONCE did this with
/**/ #	symbolic links. But when we deliver TAE, we deliver it without
/**/ #	object modules. Furthermore, we do not require users on SUN 3
/**/ #	systems to run the installation procedure. Therefore, if clib.a
/**/ #	is a link to cmput.o, and cmput.o does not get delivered, this
/**/ #	produces problems. So instead we have taken this route of copying
/**/ #	cmput.o to clib.a.
