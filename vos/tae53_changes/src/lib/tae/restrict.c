/*
 *	Restricted allocation package.
 *
 *	This package allows the caller to "package" linked data structures
 *	into a block of memory and send the block to another process.  The
 *	receiving process can re-construct the pointers.
 *
 *	To use the R package, the caller defines a storage area of type
 *      ALIGN, dimensioned according to how much storage is needed.
 *	The macro STORAGE in RESINC.INC simplifies the allocation of
 *	the storage block.  
 *
 *	The area is initialized with the r_init function; it builds a 
 *	control block at the beginning of the area to keep track of
 * 	allocation.  The caller can allocate storage from the area
 *	using the r_alloc function -- it is similar to calloc but 
 *	allocates within the storage block.
 *
 *	The r_setrel and r_setabs functions allow for conversions of
 *	pointers in the storage block to/from a "block relative" format.
 *
 * CHANGE LOG:
 *
 *	11-jul-83	Purged change log, deleted checkout records,
 *			and audited global definitions...jtm
 *	18-feb-84	Use COMPACT_COUNT to keep parblk format same
 *			from v1.1 to v1.2....palm
 *	15-sep-86	Explain why r_dealloc is nothing...palm
 *	30-mar-87	Change R_BLOCK to use COMPACT_UCOUNT rather than
 *			COMPACT_COUNT so we get up to 64Kb in a block
 *			while maintaining compatibility with existing
 *			PAR files...palm
 * 10-apr-92	Prevent r_init and r_newsize from allocating a pool so big 
 *		that the pool and the parblk header do not fit into a record of
 *		size MAX_COMPACT_UCOUNT. When we change the parblk
 *		size field to a LONG, this will no longer be necessary...krw
 * 05-may-92    Changed pool and parblk fields: MAX_COMPACT_UCOUNT to 
 *		LARGE_P_BYTES and COMPACT_UCOUNT to LONG and removed previous
 *		temporarily work around...tpl
