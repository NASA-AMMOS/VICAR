<p>Agile2D is a package for rendering Java2D Graphics via the OpenGL pipeline. It
uses the Java Games JOGL OpenGL bindings to access OpenGL. 

<h4>OpenGL for Two-Dimensional Graphics</h4>

<p>OpenGL is an interesting graphics API for a number of reasons. It
is highly scalable and widely supported. It runs on everything ranging
from affordable game cards to graphics supercomputers. It is designed
to support hardware acceleration for a wide range of useful graphics
operations. It offers the potential for mixing two-dimensional and
three-dimensional graphics in the same space. It also opens the door
to using advanced rendering tricks (e.g. vertex shaders) for graphics,
if you are prepared to write low-level code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, OpenGL has poor support for two-dimensional
graphics. Certain very common 2D tasks are not included in the core
OpenGL API.  It is missing a standard font library, font hinting, 2D
concave polygons, thick lines, arbitrary clip regions, and large
images.</p>
 
<p>By implementing the standard Java2D API using OpenGL, the Agile2D
OpenGL Renderer aims to hide many of the downsides of OpenGL as a 2D
rendering engine, whilst maximizing the opportunities for hardware
acceleration.</p>

<h4>Accelerated Graphics</h4>

<p>A range of interesting applications run significantly faster under
OpenGL than under other 2D APIs. This is because OpenGL graphics cards
can accelerate certain operations in hardware. Opportunities for
acceleration include:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Alpha blending (compositing)
<li>Image warping (texture mapping)
<li>Antialiasing
<li>Double buffering
<li>Gradient painting
<li>Texture painting
</ul>

<p>Not all applications benefit from OpenGL acceleration. Indeed, not all
computers have special OpenGL hardware. So, in certain cases, OpenGL
may actually perform more slowly than the reference implementation of
Java2D provided in Sun's JDK.</p>

<p>Another drawback with OpenGL is that there are inconsistencies
between implementations on different cards and computers. In some
cases, OpenGL rendered graphics look different on different machines.
The Agile2D renderer may therefore look less consistent and/or
attractive than the reference Java2D renderer.</p>

<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>
  
<p>The Agile2D OpenGL Renderer is not a complete standalone
implementation of Java2D.  Rather, it bootstraps on the Java2D
implementation shipped with the Java Virtual Machine. It falls back on
the built-in Java2D renderer for certain operations. For example,
glyphs for fonts are obtained through Java2D's renderer, but rendered
via OpenGL's texture memory. </p>

<p>The Agile2D OpenGL renderer supports a reasonable subset of the
Java2D API, although not all Java2D capabilities are supported. A wide
range of applications should run reasonably well under Agile2D. For
example, Agile2D supports Java Swing components and the Java2D Demo suite.<p>

<p>Agile2D uses the <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">JOGL</a> library to 
access OpenGL from Java. JOGL is a freely available library created by the Sun Java Games group.
It supports OpenGL 1.1 on a number of different Operating Systems.</p>
