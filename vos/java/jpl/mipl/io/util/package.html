Utilities used by the VICAR Image I/O package.<br>
DOMutils is a set of methods to simplify working with XML parsers, Documents,
serializers, XPath searches, and xslt processors. The methods in DOMutils
encapsulate creating Documents. This ensures that all Documents created using
DOMutils will be compatable. The underlying implementation of Documents,
parsers etc is hidden from the user. <br>
DOMtoHashtable takes a Document created by an ImageIO IIOMetadata object and converts 
it to a Hashtable. Each nested Node becomes a new Hashtable. Created for Jedi.
It is a convenient way to access the keywords and values contained in a images label.
