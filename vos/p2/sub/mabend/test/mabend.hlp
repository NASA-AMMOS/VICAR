1 MABEND

  Print a message and abort the current program.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  call mabend( msg )
  C Calling Sequence:        zmabend( msg );

  The argument msg is REQUIRED. 
  In Fortran, it must be a quoted string or CHARACTER type.
  In C, it must be a quoted string or any other null-terminated string.

  MABEND calls XVMESSAGE to print the message and then calls ABEND.
  It is a programming convenience that often allows error checking
  to be coded as 1-line "if" statements.
