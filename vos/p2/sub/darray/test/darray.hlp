1 DARRAY

  DARRAY packs and unpacks double precision data arrays.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence: 
                          INTEGER*4 MODE,I,J,N,M
                          REAL*8 S(DIMX,DIMY), D(DIMX,DIMY)
                          CALL DARRAY(MODE,I,J,N,M,S,D)
  C Calling Sequence: 
                          int mode,i,j,n,m
                          double s(dimx,dimy), d(dimx,dimy)
                          darray(mode,i,j,n,m,s,d)


             mode - specifies whether to pack or unpack the arrays
                s - the array that is used for packing
                d - the array that is used for unpacking
              i,j - specifies the dimension for the s array
              n,m - specifies the dimension for the d array
           
             Note:  FORTRAN treats things in column-major order, while C
                    uses row-major order.  The C subscripts in the array
                    needs to be reversed prior to to calling the sequence.

                    The dimensions of the arrays should be specified by
                    the user.

2 Operation

  DARRAY is the double precision analog of the IBM SSP routine ARRAY.
  The DARRAY calling sequence and variables are identical to those of
  ARRAY except that the variables S and D in DARRAY are type double
  precision.  It can be used to pack and unpack data in the arrays.
