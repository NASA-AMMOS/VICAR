1 RECTPATCH
  For simple cylindrical projection, returns line of equator, longitude
of sample 1.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence: 

  CALL RECTPATCH(RDATA)

     where:

  RDATA is 40 word real*4 array containing geometry data as specified in
  subroutine CONVEV.  Elements 1,2,3 and 6 will be changed.

  Original Programmer: Joel Mosher 19-APR-1986
  Current Cognizant Programmer: Steve Pohorsky

  REVISION HISTORY
    2-4-93   SP   Minor cleanup: Changed (RLON.gE.360.0001) to (RLON .GT. 360.0)
                  and changed 3.14159265358 to 3.141592653589793D0
2 Operation
 RECTPATCH uses data in RDATA to calculate line of equator and longitude of 
 sample 1.  Elements 1,2,3 and 6 will be changed accordingly.

 RECTPATCH is intended for use only on rectangular projections, so if 
 RDATA(39) is not 10, then it returns without any processing.  (Please note that
 RDATA(39) is stored in INTEGER format and thus is not equal to 10.0.)
