1 DGELG

  DGELG is a FORTRAN and C-callable, UNIX-ported subroutine which 
  solves a general system of simultaneous linear equations.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  

                call DGELG(R,A,M,N,EPS,IFAIL)

  Arguments: 
		R (input)	double precision M by N right hand side matrix.
				On return, R contains the solutions of the 
				equations.
		A (input)	double precision M by M coefficient matrix.
                                A is modified by DGELG.
		M (input)	integer number of equations in the system
		N (input)	number of right hand side vectors
		EPS (input)     Not used in this implimentation.
		IFAIL(output)	a resulting error parameter.  IFAIL=0
                                if DGELG is successful.

  C Calling Sequence:  

                zdgelg(r,a,m,n,eps,ifail);

  Arguments: 
		double *r;      (input/output) 
                                M by N right hand side matrix. 
				On return, R contains the solutions of the 
				equations.
		double *a;      (input/output)	
                                M by M coefficient matrix. A is modified by 
                                DGELG.
		int m;          (input)	number of equations in the system
		int n;          (input)	number of right hand side vectors
		int eps;        (input) ** NOT USED **
		int ifail;      (outpu) a resulting error parameter. IFAIL=0
                                if DGELG is successful.

2 Operation

	  This subroutine uses the MATH77 routines (from LINPACK)
          DGEFA and DGESLD.

2 Arguments

	R (input)	double precision M by N right hand side matrix.
			On return, R contains the solutions of the 
			equations.
	A (input)	double precision M by M coefficient matrix.
                        A is modified by SIMQ.
	M (input)	integer number of equations in the system
	N (input)	number of right hand side vectors
	EPS (input)     Not used in this implimentation.
	IFAIL(output)	a resulting error parameter.  IFAIL=0
                        if DGELG is successful.
