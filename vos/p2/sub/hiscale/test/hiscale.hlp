1 HISCALE

  Purpose: HISCALE compresses a 64K grey-level histogram of a halfword image
  to 256 grey levels by scaling the DN values.  See also GETSCALE.

  Calling Sequence:

	CALL HISCALE(HIS,NPXLS,SCALE,OHIS,LSAT,HSAT)
  where
	INTEGER*4 HIS(65536)	!Input histogram
	INTEGER*4 NPXLS		!Total number of pixels in histogram (input)
	REAL*4 SCALE		!Scale applied to histogram (input)
	INTEGER*4 OHIS(256)	!Output histogram
	REAL*4 LSAT,HSAT	!Percent of pixels saturated at low and hight
				!ends of the histogram (outputs)

  The subroutines HISCALE and GETSCALE are used to prepare histograms for
  display.  See program HICCUP for an example of their use.

2 Operation

  The input histogram is assumed to cover the full halfword (16-bit integer)
  range, where

	HIS(1) = number of pixels at -32768 DN
	HIS(2) = number of pixels at -32767 DN
          .    .   .
          .    .   .
          .    .   .
	HIS(65536) = number of pixels at +32767 DN

  HISCALE rescales the histogram so that it is equivalent to the histogram of
  an image whose pixels have been multiplied by the given scale factor, and
  truncated so that all DN values less than 0 are replaced by 0, and all DN
  values greater than 255 are replaced by 255.  The elements of OHIS are
  defined as follows:

	OHIS(1) = number of pixels at 0 DN
	OHIS(2) = number of pixels at 1 DN
          .    .   .
          .    .   .
	OHIS(256) = number of pixels at 255 DN

  Upon return, LSAT and HSAT will contain the percentage of pixels truncated
  at the low and high ends of the histogram (i.e. LSAT=percentage less than
  0 DN and HSAT=percentage greater than 255 DN).

Revisions:	April 01, 1992		JFM059		FR 75746
		Test of NPTS parameter to avoid divide by zero error.

12 NOV 92  FFM  Made portable, revised test program
24 MAR 93  FFM  Modified HISCALE's IMAKE file, changed subroutine's name from
                upper case to lower case, so it will delete the IMAKE file, etc,
                after it is built.
12 JUL 93  FFM  Commented out LIB_LOCAL in THISCALE.IMAKE file. (FR 81858)
03 Feb 98  GMY  Included min and max DN values in LSAT and HSAT calculations.
01 Apr 98  GMY  Corrected alpha pathname in test file (AR9703)
