1 MVM73A

2  PURPOSE

     To provide the calling program a buffer containing nominal MVM
     distortion correction data in the GEOMA format.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

     CALL MVM73A(BUF)

2  ARGUMENTS

     BUF    is an 840 word array of GEOMA parameters returned.

     MVM73A should be called to set data for the "A" camera, and
     MVM73B for the "B" camera.

2  OPERATION

     The data in the array is similar to the format as the parameter
     dataset which can be input to GEOMA.  The difference between the
     two formats is in the first word.  This subroutine begins with
     NAH and the first word in the GEOMA dataset is the number of words
     (840) following the first word.
