1 FLIGHT_LABEL

  FLIGHT_LABEL outputs to the display the flight label of a Galileo SSI image.
  Flight_label also returns a pointer to a link list that contains the 
  information printed on the display.  If the input file is not a Galileo SSI 
  image, FLIGHT_LABEL returns NULL.

  Calling Sequence:

  FLIGHT_LABEL ( UNIT )

  where	UNIT is the unit number of the file of interest.  The file may or
  may not be open before this subroutine is called.  If the file is closed
  this subroutine will open it and then close it once the flight label has
  been displayed.

2 Display Format

  This display of SSI flight label items is identical to that of Vicar program
  LABLIST (see also MSD:384-89-165).  There are three possible formats for
  displaying the SSI labels
    
  (1) If the input image is ICT compressed, the label items will be organized and
  printed in the following format:

  GLL/SSI  PICNO=12A0001     FILTER=3(VIO)  TLMFMT=XXX    TARGET=CALLISTO
  RIM=1/16777215:90:9:7      EXP=51200.00   FIBE=1001     TCA=-003 23:13:00  
  SCET=1995.123 12:23:56     GAIN=1(400K)   COMP=ICT      COMP RATIO=24.23
  PA=NNIOOOOOO#MMSSSSXXXX    RATE=60 2/3    ENTROPY=2.23  HUF=ABCDEFG
  QSTEP=20      QM=ABCDEFG   ZZ=ABCDEFG     TW=(353,353)  ROI=(101,101,600,500)
  INA= 89.12  TWST=359.99    SUNAZ=359.99   BOOM=NO       HSCL=1.2345E5 M/PXL   
  EMA=180.00  CONE=179.99    SMRAZ=359.99   SMEAR=99.99   VSCL=1.2345E5 M/PXL   
  PHA=179.33  RA=359.99      S/CAZ=359.99   LAT=-90.00    PLANETRNG=123456789
  HRA=130.31  DEC=-90.00     NORAZ=359.99   LON=359.99    SLANT RNG=123456789
  CAL=RADIOMETRIC-FILENAME   IOF=1.0000E-3  UBWC=YES      SOLAR RNG=123456789
  DC=DARKCURRENT-FILENAME    CNV=3.5135E-2
  BLM=BLEMISH-FILENAME       SO=SHUT-OFFSET-FILENAME      EDR=GES006622/066
  
  (2) If the input image was losslessly compressed via the Huffman compressor,
  the output format is the same as above except that the line containing
  label items QSTEP, QM, ZZ, TW, and ROI is not printed. 
  
  (3) If the input image is not ICT compressed or losslessly compressed using the
  Huffman compressor, the output format is as follows:

  GLL/SSI  PICNO=12A0001     FILTER=3(VIO)  TLMFMT=***    TARGET=CALLISTO
  RIM=1/16777215:90:9:7      EXP=51200.00   FIBE=1001     TCA=-003 23:13:00  
  SCET=1995.123 12:23:56     GAIN=1(400K)   COMP=RC       TRUNC BITS/PXL=2.34
  PA=NNIOOOOOO#MMSSSSXXXX    RATE=60 2/3    ENTROPY=2.23  TRUNC PXLS/LNE=123
  INA= 89.12  TWST=359.99    SUNAZ=359.99   BOOM=NO       HSCL=1.2345E5 M/PXL   
  EMA=180.00  CONE=179.99    SMRAZ=359.99   SMEAR=99.99   VSCL=1.2345E5 M/PXL   
  PHA=179.33  RA=359.99      S/CAZ=359.99   LAT=-90.00    PLANETRNG=123456789
  HRA=130.31  DEC=-90.00     NORAZ=359.99   LON=359.99    SLANT RNG=123456789
  CAL=RADIOMETRIC-FILENAME   IOF=1.0000E-3  UBWC=YES      SOLAR RNG=123456789
  DC=DARKCURRENT-FILENAME    CNV=3.5135E-2
  BLM=BLEMISH-FILENAME       SO=SHUT-OFFSET-FILENAME      EDR=GES006622/066
  
  If any of the label items are not found in the input file specified by the
  user, asterisks are printed in place of the value.  If a vicar command error 
  is encountered, "ERRxxx" is printed after the keyword.  xxx is the VICAR 
  error message number found in appendix B of the VICAR Run-Time Library  
  Reference Manual.

		November 1990	Task name determined by SENSOR label item.

  Ported to UNIX by:  W.P. Lee,       May-1992
  Revisions on Ported Version:

  June-1992... W.P. Lee  1. Enabled #include "xvmaininc.h" statement in the 
                            source code
                         2. Made n[15] array to be static so that it would print
                            out sensible MOD91 value for image of old label for-
                            mat
                    
                            
  Galileo Phase II additions and changes: G. Connor,   January 1994
  July-1996   O.A.Montoya  Added capability to return a link list that contains
                           the information printed on the display.  This 
                           information can be used by programs such as MASKV. 
                           Modified to display correctly PHASEII data(FR89392).
  August-1996 O.A.Montoya  Modified code to search for DC, CAL, BLM and SO in 
                           both the first and Galsos tasks (FR89811).

  June 30, 1998 T.Huang    Modified to be Year 2000 compilance. 
                           Converted to ANSI C.
