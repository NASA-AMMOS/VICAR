1 VICAR SUBROUTINE mpPConstants

PURPOSE

The function mpPConstants retrieves planetary constants 
values from a designated NAIF/SPICE PCK file and places
them in the MP data object.

2 OPERATION

This function takes as input the file name of a NAIF SPICE
planetary constants kernel and a target body name and fills 
the planetary constants portion of the MP data object with 
the respective kernel values.  This NAIF SPICE Toolkit and
its special collection of Galileo functions are required for
this function.


CALLING SEQUENCE		

from C		status = mpPConstants( MP mp, char *file_name, 
				char *target_body_name );

from FORTRAN	status = mp_pconstants( mp, file_name, 
				target_body_name ) 

Necessary include files
from calling routine 
or program:			mp_routines.h


ARGUMENTS

INPUT 	

mp			(MP type)

A pointer to the MP data structure as returned mpInit. 
In FORTRAN, this variable is of type REAL*8.  MP type
is defined in include file mp_routines.h.

file_name		(character string)

Full file pathname of NAIF/SPICE PCK file (planetary constants 
kernel - P_CONSTANTS.KER)

target_body_name	(character string)

Full NAIF standard target body name.


RETURN

status 			(integer)

Status flag for the operation of the routine. 
Zero (0) signifies success and -1 failure.
