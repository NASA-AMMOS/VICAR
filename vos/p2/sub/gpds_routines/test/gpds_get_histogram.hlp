1 VICAR ROUTINE GPDS_GET_HISTOGRAM

PURPOSE

GPDS_GET_HISTOGRAM is a MIPS PDS utility to retrieve the histogram object in
a PDS labeled file as a pointer to a one dimensional histogram array.

CALLING SEQUENCE

	#include "gpdsroutines.h"

	main ()
	{

	AGGREGATE *label_ptr;
	unsigned integer *histogram;
	char *object_name;
	char *input_file_name;
	int status_flag; 
	int number_elements, element_size;

	....
	
	label_ptr = gpds_open_file( input_file_name, &status_flag );
	
	....
	
	histogram = gpds_get_histogram( label_ptr, input_file_name, 
		object_name, &number_elements, &element_size, &status_flag );
	....
	
	gpds_close_file( label_ptr );

	....

	}

INPUT

	label_pointer	(AGGREGATE type)

	This is a pointer to the root of the PDS label. It is returned by the
	routine GPDS_OPEN_FILE.

	input_file_name (pointer to character string)

	This is a complete pathname for the PDS standard, PDS labeled input
	file which contains a histogram object.

	object_name  	(pointer to character string)

	This is the PDS object name (exact spelling including underscores)
	in which the histogram is stored in the input file. This name is 
	searched for in the PDS label of the input file. The default 
	object_name is RAW_IMAGE_HISTOGRAM (e.g. the software searches
	the PDS label of the input file for the following occurence
	'OBJECT = RAW_IMAGE_HISTOGRAM' in the default case).

RETURN

	histogram 	(unsigned integer array)

	This is the pointer to a histogram of data type unsigned integer.
	The number of elements in the histogram is returned by the output
	parameter number_elements. The maximum dimension of this array is
	65536, to accomodate images of up to two bytes per pixel.

OUTPUT

	number_elements	(integer)

	This is the number of elements returned in the array that is 
	pointed by "histogram". The maximum valid value returned by
	this argument is 65536.

	elements_size 	(integer)

	This is the number of bytes in each element returned in the 
	histogram array.

	status_flag 	(integer)

	This is an indicator of the success or failure of the returning the
	value of a PDS keyword. The following are the meanings of the 
	returned values:

	0	successful returning of pointer to histogram array

	-1	failure in finding necessary label information to proceed
		with retrieval of histogram values from input file

	-2	error in opening input file (argument input_file_name)

	-3	invalid data type (DATA_TYPE PDS keyword) found in label of 
		input file; gpds_get_histogram only supports unsigned integer 
		data types.

	-4	invalid bytes per item (ITEM_BYTES PDS keyword) found in 
		label of input file.

	-5	invalid number of elements in histogram object found in 
		label of input file.

	-6	memory allocation error for buffer to hold record read from
		input file.
