1 SDRDATE

  Routine to convert SFDU time format to SDR time format.

  C Calling Sequence:  zsdrdate(sfdut,sdrt,*sdr_year)

  Arguments:  struct sfdu_time sfdut	!Output Epoch 1950 time
	      struct sdr_time  sdrt     !Input Julian day_of_year,sec_of_hour,
					 and millisecond of second.
	      int *sdr_year		!Input year of century (0-99)

  Note: Data structures sfdu_time and sdr_time may be obtained by including
        SFDUTIME.H from the C-Include Library.
  
  FORTRAN Calling Sequence: SDRDATE(SFDUT1,SFDUT2,SDRTIM,SDR_YEAR) 

  Arguments:  INTEGER*4 SFDUT1, SFDUT2, SDR_YEAR
              INTEGER*2 SDRTIM(3)
  
  For SDRDATE:

             The sfdut structure or SFDUT1 and SFDUT2 are the inputs
             where the first object in sfdut and SFDUT1 are the seconds
             since 1950 and the second object in sfdut and SFDUT2 are the
             fractional seconds.

             The output for SDRDATE is the year (SDR_YEAR or sdr_year) and
             for the sdrt structure and SDRTIM(3) array the hour of year,
             second of hour, and msec of second.

3 Operation

  This routine is valid between 1950 and 2050.  The only obscure part of 
  the code is the calculation of leap years.  Starting from 0 A.D., leap
  years are all years divisible by 4, except years divisible by 100 but not
  by 400.  Note that the year 2000 is a leap year.  To keep things simple,
  this routine ignores the 100 and 400 years rules since they cancel out for
  the coming century.

  The year 1900 is used as a base for calculating leap years, rather than 
  the year 0 to reduce the possibility of round-off errors.  The total
  number of days elasped for the year 1900 to the beginning of the current
  year is 365.25*year + 0.75.  The 0.75 adjusts for the century (1900) 
  starting on a leap year.  The total number of days elapsed since the year
  1950 is:

         days = 365.25*year+0.75            !days since 1900
                    - 18263                 !days between 1900 and 1950
                    + 0.125                 !half of 0.25 to reduce rnd-off err
