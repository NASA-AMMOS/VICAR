1 XYZTORGB

    This program provides information necessary to convert from
    tristimulus values to image device inputs.  It currently works only
    for the Conrac 7211 LP color monitor, although it contains code which
    may be used later for film recorders. 

  Calling Sequence:

  	xyztorgb(device,ttr,offset),

  where

    device (input) is the address of a zero-terminated character string
	    denoting the output device (currently only "TV" is valid) 
    ttr (output) is the address of a 9-element double (float) array
    offset (output) is the address of a 3-element double (float) array

2 History

  Original Programmer: 		R. Brill, 20 June 1986 
  Current Cognizant Programmer: R. Brill, 20 June 1986 
  Source Language: C

2 Operation

      The table of device information is searched for the appropriate
    tristimulus values.  If they are not found, then they are calculated
    and placed in the table.  The matrix of such values (and offsets) are
    then inverted and returned to the caller.  (This last step is
    inappropriate for a film recorder; another computation will be done
    when that device is implemented).  The subroutine is not simply a
    table of values; it has been designed so that the tables that do exist
    contain the data that can be measured, and the program calculates the
    data the is required. 

      The file also contains subroutines (used by XYZTORGB) to obtain the
    inverse, the determinant, and the cofactors of an arbitrary-sized
    array. 

    Example (in C): 

    get_dn(tristim,dn)
    double tristim[3];                          /*tristimulus values*/
    double dn[3];                               /*dn values for monitor*/
    {
      double rgb,xyz,ttr,offset;
  
      status = xyztorgb("TV",ttr,offset);       /*get ttr,offset for TV*/
      if (status = -1) {
        return;                                 /*no such device*/
      }
      for (rgb = 0; rgb < 3; rgb++) {           /*for each primary*/
        intensity = ttr[rgb][0] * tristim[0] +  /*get intensity*/
		    ttr[rgb][1] * tristim[1] +
		    ttr[rgb][2] * tristim[2] +
		    offset[rgb];
        dn[rgb] = pow(intensity,1/2.6);         /*get dn*/
      }
    }

2 Arguments

      The calling program performs the transformation for a monitor as
    follows: 

	    rgb = ttr * xyz + offset, 

      where xyz and rgb are vectors of tristimulus values and red, green,
    and blue   intensities, respectively.  The input dn for any phosphor
    is given by 

	    DN = I ** 1/2.6 (see HELP GIACONDA). 

      The function returns -1 if the device does not exist, 1 otherwise.
