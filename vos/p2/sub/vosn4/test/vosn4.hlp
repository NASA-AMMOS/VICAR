1 VOSN4

2  PURPOSE

     To provide the calling program a buffer containing nominal Viking
     Orbiter distortion correction data in the GEOMA format.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

     CALL VOSN4(BUF)


     BUF    is an 800 word array of GEOMA parameters returned.

     VOSN4 should be called to get data for the camera serial number 4.
     VOSN6 should be called to get data for the camera serial number 6.
     VOSN7 should be called to get data for the camera serial number 7.
     VOSN8 should be called to get data for the camera serial number 8.

2  OPERATION

     The data in the array is similar to the format as the parameter
     file which can be input to GEOMA.  The difference between the
     two formats is in the first word.  This subroutine begins with
     NAH and the first word in the GEOMA dataset is the number of words
     (800) following the first word.
