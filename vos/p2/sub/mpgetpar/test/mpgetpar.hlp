1 VICAR SUBROUTINE		mpgetpar

Purpose				

Routine to extract map projection values defined
by VICAR/TAE procedure definition file (.PDF)
for an application program and initialize a 
map projection data object using mpInit for 
subsequent use in performing point map 
transformations using mpll2xy and mpxy2ll, 
part of the mp_routine suite of map projection 
software.

2 OPERATION

Reads in values for a specific map projection
stored in VICAR parmeter values from an
application program .pdf file and initializes
a map projection data object with those values. 
This routine uses the VICAR Run Time Library 
(VICAR RTL) and the mp routines mpInit, mpSetValues
and mpPConstants.

Libraries and subroutines required to run this
routine: mp_routines, NAIF SPICELIB library

Calling Sequence:		

from C  	status = mpGetPar( mp, pdf_parameters, 
				pds_standard_keywords,
				SPICE_PCK_pathname );

from FORTRAN	status = mp_get_par( mp, pdf_parameters, 
				pds_standard_keywords,
				SPICE_PCK_pathname );

Necessary include files
from calling routine 
or program:			mp.h


INPUT 

	pdf_parameters		(2-D character array)

	A two-dimensional character array that contains
	the actual names of VICAR pdf parameters
	for the map projection specific values. 

	pds_standard_keywords	(2-D character array)

	A two-dimensional character array that contains 
	the Actual PDS standard keyword names used in
	map projection software suite (mp_routines.com)
	found in the file mp.h. A NULL entry for a 
	character string ('\0') in this array signals
	the end of the listing of keywords.

	SPICE_PCK_pathname	(character string)

	The full pathname of the NAIF SPICE PCK file
	(planetary constants kernel file) to be used
	to extract target body radii if not provided
	via the pdf parameters.

OUTPUT

	mp			(MP data type)

	The address of map projection data object.
	
RETURN 		

	status 			(integer)

	This is an indicator of the success or failure of
	retrieving various values for the VICAR pdf file
	and initializing the map projection data object.

	0 	successful call to mpgetpar and
	-1 	failure in reading of VICAR pdf parameter 
		values or error in setting of values in 
		map projection data object.

2 MORE ON ARGUMENTS

For character string array inputs ...

of pdf parameter names and PDS standard keyword names, 
the dimension of these arrays should be declared in the 
application program with the outer dimension being set to 
mpNUMBER_OF_KEYWORDS. mpNUMBER_OF_KEYWORDS is the maximum 
number of keywords that can be set in a map projection 
data object by functions in the mp_routines suite. 

For the parameter "pdf_parameters", the inner dimension 
should be set to mpMAX_PARM_LENGTH + 1. mpMAX_PARM_LENGTH 
is the maximum allowable number of characters in a VICAR 
procedure definition file (pdf) parameter name. 

For the parameter "pds_standard_keywords", the inner 
dimension should be set to mpMAX_KEYWD_LENGTH + 1. 
mpMAX_KEYWD_LENGTH is the maximum allowable number of 
characters in a standard PDS keywords name. 

The values mentioned above can be found in the include 
file mp.h. Thus a sample initialization of these arrays 
in preparation for a call to MPGETPAR is shown below.

  char PDF_parms[mpNUMBER_OF_KEYWORDS][mpMAX_PARM_LENGTH+1];
  char PDS_keywords[mpNUMBER_OF_KEYWORDS][mpMAX_KEYWD_LENGTH+1];
