2 Operation

       This routine is a modification of the routine CORCAL as it
     was in SUPERMAP.   Given a control net of three or more
     points  on a planetary image, the routine will calculate the
     planet to camera transformation matrix.
       This version allows more than three points to be used in the
     transformation calculation.  If more than 3 image points are
     specified, then a Linear Least Squares solution to the
     problem is obtained.  Redundancy in control point specification
     improves the transformation matrix soln.
