1 PBNAME

2  PURPOSE

  PBNAME and PBID were originally written as Voyager-specific subroutines.
  They now simply call the corresponding SPICE routines and are supported
  only for backwards compatibility in existing VICAR programs.

  Given the target-body name, PBID will return the corresponding target-body
  ID as specified in the NAIF SPICE software. Given the target-body ID,
  PBNAME will return corresponding target-body name.

  CALLING SEQUENCE:

       CALL PBNAME(ID,name,&nnn)     or
       CALL PBID(NAME,id,&nnn)

  where 
       INTEGER*4 ID	   is the target-body ID
       CHARACTER*12 NAME   is the target-body name
       &nnn		   is the statement label of an alternate return 

  ID is input to PBNAME and output by PBID.
  NAME is input to PBID and output by PBNAME.
  NAME must be left justified and padded on the right with blanks.
  The alternate return is taken if an unidentified ID or NAME is detected.

  "C" CALLING SEQUENCE:
       int i,id;
       char par[13];
       i = zpbname(id,name)     or
       i = zpbid(name,id)
  where i=1 for success and i=0 for failure.

2 OPERATION

  Tables of target names and target numbers are maintained internal to the
  subroutine (i.e. no SPICE files are accessed).
