3 Operation

  This subroutine grabs the entire label (up to 7200 bytes long)
  using XLGETLABEL and then locates the conversion factors by
  searching for the characters 'MULTIPLIED DN VALUE BY'.

4 Arguments

  UNIT (unit): standard Vicar2 unit number for the image whose label is
         to be searched.

  BUF (buf): buffer to hold the label; this should contain up to 7200 bytes.
       
  CON (con): if MODE is 0 or 1, then this should be one longword (REAL*4);
       if MODE is 2, then this should be dimensioned CON(2).

  MODE (mode)

  MODE=0: the conversion factor to microwatts/cm**2/steradian/nanometer
          is returned.
  MODE=1: the conversion factor to Albedo*10000 is returned.
  MODE=2: both are returned.$ if p1.eqs."HELP" then exit
