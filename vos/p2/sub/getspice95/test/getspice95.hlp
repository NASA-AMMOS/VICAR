1 GETSPICE
 
  Description:

	VICAR2 subroutine GETSPICE95 to return the spice navigation 
	data for an image from GLL. It can (will) be expanded to include
	other flight project. But for now, only GLL is supported because
	data from other project are not available.

	Users should be aware that these routines clear the SPICE kernel 
	pool before returning, so subsequent calls to SPICE routines will 
	fail unless INIT_SPICE() or an equivalent routine is called.

2 ARGUMENTS

  INPUT ARGUMENTS:
     mode     = 0 use local spice kernels
	      = 1 use MIPS spice kernel via "spiceserver"

     sc_id    = GLL VGR_1 VGR_2
     camera   = SSI ...
     scet     = year, date, hour, min, sec, mili-sec.
		of the data seg you want to retrieve.
		These info can be retrieved using
		getlabcon, they are in data(8-14),
		where data is the buffer returned by getlabcon
		
     target_name = name of the target object, getlabcon will
		return this for you. The target should be in
		the data[24] in C or data(25) in fortran, where
		data is the buffer returned by getlabcon
 
     system   = B1950 or J2000

     source   = SEDR source                                     character*4
                Valid are: DAVI NAV FARE NAV2 NEAR AMOS NTEL AACS NPRE
 		Notice that the source string are all in upper case. If
		you supply lower cased string, it will automatically
		converted to upper case, before sending the request
		to SpiceServer or before calling spice95.
 
     usr_info = provenance information used to select data
		from MIPS spice kernel. When calling getspice95,
		user can be more specific in the type of data
		they are looking for, by specifying appropriate
		values in usr_info structure

		fortran format: character*10 usr_info(10)
		C       format: struct prov_info_typ {
					char inst[5],
					     purpose[5],
					     prog_name[7],
					     sp_ref[5],
					     req_no[5],
					     year[5],
					     month_day[5],
					     hour_min[5],
					     file_id[5],
					     usr_grp_id[7];
					     }
		FORTRAN   	C
		usr_info(1)	inst[5]
			- specifies where the data segment comes from.
			  So far "NAIF" and "MIPS" are valid because
			  MIPS kernel only contain data from MIPS and
			  NAIF. As more user add data to MIPS kernel,
			  more inst values will become available to select

		usr_info(2)	purpose[5]
			- specifies the reason the data segment was produced,
			  what is it for, etc.
			  A user reading data from MIPS kernel might chose to
			  to read data from specific purpose (e.g. LIMB NAVIG.,
			  C-SMITHING, etc.).
			  default: "NONE"

		usr_info(3)	prog_name[7]
			- name of program that produce the data segment
			  default: "*NONE*"

		usr_info(4)	sp_ref[5]
			- id number of SPK file which was used to produce
			  the data segment. SPK id number are defined in
			  MIPS KERNELDB
			  default: "NONE"

		usr_info(5)	req_no[5]
			- request or job id of the process which produces
			  the data segment.
			  default: "NONE"

		usr_info(6)	year[5]
			- year that the data segment was produced
			  default: "0000"

		usr_info(7)	month_day[5]
			- month and day that the data segment was produced
			  default: "0000"

		usr_info(8)	hour_min[5]
			- hour and minute that the data segment was produced
			  default: "0000"

		usr_info(9)	file_id[5]
			- MIPS kernel file id the user want to read data from.
			  This is useful for users who want to read data only
			  from a specific kernel
			  default: "NONE"

		usr_info(10)	usr_grp_id[7]		
			- if user only want data from a specific group or
			  user, then specify the user or group name here.
			  default: "*NONE*"

		*** it might take longer to retrieve data when calling getspice95()
		    with provenance information. This is because getspice95() search
		    throught the whole MIPS kernel to retrieve the requested segment.
		    If the requested segment is not found, the latest data segment
		    which has the same sclk value with the specified image is returned.

		*** if the user does not specify any provenance information,
		    getspice95() ignores usr_info and retrieves the latest
		    data segment with the same sclk value with the specified image.

		*** items in usr_info are all in character format. This is because
		    each CK data segment id can only be 40 character long. There
		    won't be enough from in the segment id to pack non-character
		    provenance information.

		*** for C calling sequence, getspice95() returns an
                    integer as its indicator code.

		*** getspice95() assumes the input buffer is empty. It calls
		    getlabcon() to fill in the SCET data, then call spice95()

3. HISTORY

Written By:   S Le     JUN-19-95      

   Apr. 29, 1998  ...T.Huang...   Modified to work with the new MSPICE 
                                  subroutines.
                                  Removed packing of file_id (ck_id) into
                                  seg_id to prevent illegal memory access.
                                  Removed SPC subroutine calls.

   May 21, 1998   ...T.Huang...   Added subroutine ADD_SPACE to insert 
                                  blank space to entries: INSTITUTE, 
                                  PURPOSE, PROGRAM, SPKID, and REQNUM to 
                                  assist SEG_ID construction and search.

   Oct 22, 1998   ...T.Huang...   Modifed to return the correct status.
                                  (i.e. 1=SUCCESS, 0=FAILURE).
                                  The 'msclt' and 'mslcl' subroutines return
                                  0 for success and -1 for failure.

   Jun 03, 1999   ...T.Huang...   Obsoleted spice95.c
