1 getenv_vic 
 This routine returns the value of an environment variable (Unix) or
 logical name (VMS).  Under VMS, it will return multivalued logical
 names as a comma-separated list of translations.

 Calling sequence (Fortran):

     call xgetenv_vic(name, value)

 Both arguments are character*n variables.  A blank string is
 returned if the name is not found.

 Calling sequence (C):

     value = getenv_vic("NAME");

 Just like getenv(), the return value is a pointer to a static
 array.  So, the value must be used or copied before this routine
 (or getenv()) is called again.  NULL is returned if the name is
 not found.
