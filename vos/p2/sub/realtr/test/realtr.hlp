REALTR

1	Calling sequence:

      SUBROUTINE REALTR(A,B,N,ISN)

2	Arguments:

IF ISN=1, THIS SUBROUTINE COMPLETES THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
	OF 2*N REAL DATA VALUES, WHERE THE ORIGINAL DATA VALUES ARE
	STORED ALTERNATELY IN ARRAYS A AND B, AND ARE FIRST
	TRANSFORMED BY A COMPLEX FOURIER TRANSFORM OF DIMENSION N.
	THE COSINE COEFFICIENTS ARE IN A(1),A(2),...A(N+1) AND
	THE SINE COEFFICIENTS ARE IN B(1),B(2),...B(N+1).
	A TYPICAL CALLING SEQUENCE IS
	  CALL FFT(A,B,N,N,N,1)
	  CALL REALTR(A,B,N,1)
	THE RESULTS SHOULD BE MULTIPLIED BY 0.5/N TO GIVE THE
	USUAL SCALING OF COEFFICIENTS.

IF ISN=-1, THE INVERSE TRANSFORMATION IS DONE, THE FIRST STEP
	IN EVALUATING A REAL FOURIER SERIES.
	A TYPICAL CALLING SEQUENCE IS
	  CALL REALTR(A,B,N,-1)
	  CALL FFT(A,B,N,N,N,-1)
	THE RESULTS SHOULD BE MULTIPLIED BY 0.5 TO GIVE THE USUAL
	SCALING, AND THE TIME DOMAIN RESULTS ALTERNATE IN ARRAYS A
	AND B, I.E. A(1),B(1),A(2),B(2),...A(N),B(N).

THE DATA MAY ALTERNATIVELY BE STORED IN A SINGLE COMPLEX
	ARRAY A, THEN THE MAGNITUDE OF ISN CHANGED TO TWO TO
	GIVE THE CORRECT INDEXING INCREMENT AND A(2) USED TO
	PASS THE INITIAL ADDRESS FOR THE SEQUENCE OF IMAGINARY
	VALUES, E.G.
	  CALL FFT(A,A(2),N,N,N,2)
	  CALL REALTR(A,A(2),N,2)
	IN THIS CASE, THE COSINE AND SINE COEFFICIENTS ALTERNATE IN A.
