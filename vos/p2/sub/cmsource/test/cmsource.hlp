1 CMSOURCE

Given a SPICE buffer, as returned by subroutine GETSPICE95, CMSOURCE
will print the provenance information in the following format:

      CKNAME=FARE  SPKID=NO11  PROGRAM=IBISUPD  GMY059  MIPL  09/22/96


 Fortran Calling Sequence:  CALL CMSOURCE(SBUF,isource)
 C Calling Sequence:        zcmsource(SBUF,&isource);

         REAL*4 SBUF(200)      Input SBUF buffer (returned by GETSPICE)
      OR REAL*8 SBUF(100)      (From C, see HELP for GETSPICE for declaration
                                and for SBUF buffer layout.)
         INTEGER*4 ISOURCE     Output source number. (From C isource is an int.)

  ISOURCE=1  for Mert Davies' C-matrix
         =2  for FARENC
         =3  for NAV
         =4  for NAV2
         =5  for NEARENC
         =6  for AMOS
         =7  for NAIF

NOTE:
  The way source is determined is the so called "hard coded".  At this point it
checks CKID to fall within the range of M901~M906 and output the source.
However, since all the CKID-CKSOURCE corresponding should be according to the
file pointed by the environment variable KERNELDB, this is not a good way for
determination.  Meaning when KERNELDB changes, CMSOURCE.F has to be changed
to reflect.

  Revisions:
    When       Who  What
    --------   ---  -----------------------------------------------------------
    13 Jun 00  GMY  Update for VGR SPICE kernels
    14 Nov 96  SMC  Fixed to default ISOURCE to 7 (NAIF) for GLL, thus for
                      those CKID not in range M901~M906 default is returned
    12 Nov 96  SMC  Fixed to output correct ISOURCE when processing GLL (DFR)
    10 Oct 96  GMY  Added capability to print provenance data from GETSPICE95
                    buffer.
    16-Sep 94  SP   Corrected message from CMSOURCE to display the last 2 
                    digits of year (SCET) instead of first 2.
    12 Dec 92  gmy  Increase # char in frame number (fr 70977).
    16 May 90  GMY  Modify to work for GETSPICE instead of SEDR79V2.
