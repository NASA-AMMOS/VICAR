1 EXTRAP

  EXTRAP is an interpolation routine which may be used to generate an
  image, or an area of an image, from a set of randomly spaced data
  points.

2 CALLING SEQUENCE 

  CALL EXTRAP(N,L,SS,ES,PT,BUFF,RAD2)

2 ARGUMENTS

  PT	   is an INTEGER*2 input array containing the data points.
	   Each data point is stored as a triplet of the form
	   (S(i),L(i),D(i)) consisting of its sample and line 
	   coordinates and DN value, respectively.

  N	   is the number of data points in PT.

  BUF	   is an INTEGER*2 output array.  Upon return, BUF will
	   contain a line segment generated by interpolating over
	   the elements of PT.

  L,SS,ES  are the line, starting sample, and ending sammple coor-
	   dinates of the line segment returned in BUF.

  RAD2     specifies the square of the radius of an area about each
	   output pixel within which tiepoints will be used for
	   purposes of interpolation.  RAD2 is required.

  The arguments L, SS, ES, and RAD2 are input as INTEGER*4 quantities.



2 OPERATION

  Each Call to EXTRAP will generate an array consisting of the inter-
  polated grey values for the line segment specified by L,SS, and ES.
  Let (L,S) be the coordinates of a point of the line segment
  (SS<=S<=ES) and let D represent its interpolated grey value.  Then

                      __ D(i)
                      \  ___
                      /_ R^2(i)
                     ----------
                      __  1
                      \  ---
                      /_ R^2(i)

  where R(i) is the distance from (L(i),S(i)) to (L,S), and the 
  summation is performed over all data points for which R^2(i) <= RAD2.
