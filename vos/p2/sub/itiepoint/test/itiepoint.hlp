1 ITIEPOINT

    Module ITIEPOINT contains subroutines for reading and writing IBIS-2
    tiepoint files:

      IREAD_TIEPOINTS reads the tiepoint data from an IBIS2 file.
      This includes opening and closing the file.

      IWRITE_TIEPOINTS writes the tiepoint data to an IBIS2 file.
      This includes opening and closing the file.

    In the most common case,
      the TIEPOINTS array defines a geometric transformation which is applied
      to the input image to produce the output image.  The transformation is 
      defined via a grid of tiepoints.  The convention (see HELP for programs
      GEOMA and TIEPARM) is that there are NAV+1 rows of tiepoints in the grid,
      with NAH+1 tiepoints in each row.  ("row" here means a horizontally 
      arranged set of points in an image.) 
      
    In the other case the tiepoints are not constrained to form a grid.
      In this case NAH and NAV are 0 and the number of points to be written
      is specified in NPTS.
    
    The IBIS tiepoint file will have one record (IBIS row) per tiepoint.
      For the case of COLCOUNT = 4, IBIS columns 1 and 2 will contain the line
      sample coordinates of the tiepoint in the output image.  IBIS columns
      3 and 4 will contain the line and sample coordinates of the tiepoint in
      the input image.
                4 IS THE ONLY VALUE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FOR COLCOUNT.
      
2  CALLING SEQUENCE

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL IREAD_TIEPOINTS(UNIT,NAH,NAV,MAXPTS,
                                                  TIEPOINTS,COLCOUNT)
  C Calling Sequence:        ziread_tiepoints(unit,&nah,&nav,maxpts,
                                              tiepoints,colcount);
    Note the & for nah and nav, denoting the passing by address.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL IWRITE_TIEPOINTS(UNIT,NAH,NAV,NPTS,
                                                   TIEPOINTS,COLCOUNT)
  C Calling Sequence:        ziwrite_tiepoints(unit,nah,nav,npts,
                                               tiepoints,colcount);

  For either routine, ABEND is called if an error occurs.  The calling routine 
  should call XVUNIT before either routine, but the file should be closed
  when either routine is called.

2  ARGUMENTS

  IREAD_TIEPOINTS

      UNIT        VICAR unit number of IBIS file.  (input, integer)
                  (unit, maxpts, and colcount are passed by value
                  for ziread_tiepoints.)

      NAH         For gridded sets of tiepoints, there are NAH+1 tiepoints for
                  each row of tiepoints in the grid.  For non-gridded sets of
                  tiepoints, NAH is set to 0.      (output, integer)

                  rows of tiepoints in the grid.  For non-gridded sets of
                  tiepoints, NAV is set to the number of tiepoints in the
                  file, independent of MAXPTS.     (output, integer)
      MAXPTS      The maximum number of tiepoints that will be read into
                  the TIEPOINTS array.  (There are COLCOUNT array elements

                  are COLCOUNT array elements
                  per tiepoint.)                   (input, integer)

      NPTS        The number of tiepoints that will be written from
                  the TIEPOINTS array.  (There are COLCOUNT array elements

                  float *tiepoints;

      COLCOUNT    The number of data values per tiepoint = the number of
                  IBIS columns per tiepoint.  In the TIEPOINTS array, there 
                  are COLCOUNT array elements
                  per tiepoint.)                   (input, integer)
                4 IS THE ONLY VALUE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FOR COLCOUNT.

2  OPERATION

 IREAD_TIEPOINTS tries to read from the property label the values for
 NUMBER_OF_AREAS_HORIZONTAL and NUMBER_OF_AREAS_VERTICAL.  If both are
 found, the routine assumes that the IBIS file holds a gridded set of
 tiepoints.  Otherwise the routine assumes the set is non-gridded, returning
 0 for NAH and the number of rows in the file for NAV.
 The initial release assumes that the tiepoint data is in IBIS columns 1-4.

 If NAH*NAV is not 0, IWRITE_TIEPOINTS assumes that the TIEPOINTS array holds 
 a gridded set of (NAH+1)*(NAV+1) tiepoints.  Otherwise the routine assumes 
 the set is a non-gridded set of NPTS tiepoints.  For gridded tiepoint sets, 
 the routine writes to the property label the values for
 NUMBER_OF_AREAS_HORIZONTAL and NUMBER_OF_AREAS_VERTICAL.  
 The initial release assumes that the tiepoint data is in IBIS columns 1-4.
