!THIS IS A TEST OF MODULES   dfft  AND   REALTR
!THESE ROUTINES ARE SO RELATED THAT A SINGLE TEST MUST BE
!USED TO CHECK THEM.  
!
!dfft IS A GENERAL PURPOSE FFT ROUTINE   AND  REALTR  ALLOWS
!THE USE OF REAL NUMBERS INSTEAD OF COMPLEX ONES.
!THE TEST WILL DO ITS THING ON A 16x16 IMAGE.  
!FIRST, THE INPUT REAL*4 BUFFER IS PRINTED OUT.
!THEN, THE TRANSFORM IS PRINTED.
!LAST, THE TRANSFORM IS REVERSED USING THE SAME ROUTINES
!AND THE RESULT IS PRINTED.  THIS LAST RESULT SHOULD BE
!IDENTICAL WITH THE ORIGINAL INPUT BUFFER.
!
!A COMPARISON RUN DONE ON THE IBM HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE
!FILE OF EACH ROUTINE.
