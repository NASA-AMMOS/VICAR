1  dfft

         A general purpose Fast Fourier Transform routine
                                                
2  PURPOSE

     dfft is a general purpose Fast Fourier Transform routine offering
     the following features:

        * The number, n, of samples need not be a power of 2.  In fact,
          all but a very small percentage of values of n may be used.

        * Complex sample arrays of any number of subscripts may be 
          transformed.  dfft is called once per subcript.

        * The transform is done in place.

     REALTR, used in conjunction with dfft, provides a fast transform
     capability in cases involving a one-dimensional array of real
     samples.  Compared with complex samples, this saves nearly a factor
     of two in memory space and also saves computer time.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

	Note: Due to the nature of this subroutine's call interface, the
	      last two parameters, it is not recomended for use with the
	      C language.

   A) K-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX TRANSFORM

        One call is made for each variate (subscript).  The calls may be
        made in any order.  For each variate, the call is of the form:

                  CALL dfft(A,B,NTOT,N,NSPAN,ISN,&P,&Q)

        ARGUMENTS

           A         is a REAL array containing the real components
                     of the data or Fourier coefficients.

           B         is a REAL array containing the imaginary components
                     ok the data or Fourier coefficients.

           NTOT      is the total number of complex data values.

           N         is the dimiension of the current variate.

           NSPAN/N   is the spacing of consecutive data values while
                     indexing the current variate.

           ISN       is positive for a forward transform, negative
                     for inverse.

           ISN*NSPAN/N   is the spacing of consecutive data values.           

           &P        is a reference to a statement number in the caller's
                     program to which control is transferred if N has a 
                     prime factor exceeding 23.
                        
           &Q        is a reference to a statement number in the caller's
                     program to which control is transferred if the square-
                     free prrtion of N has two or more factors and exceed 
                     210 or if the number of prime factors exceeds 208.

        If A and B are independent arrays, ISN should be plus or minus 1 for
        the forward and inverse transforms, respectively.  If real and 
        imaginary parts are adjacent, A(2) should be substituted for B in 
        the call sequence and the magnitude of ISN should be 2.

   B) ONE-DIMENSIONAL REAL TRANSFORM

        Forward transform

                  CALL dfft(A,A(2),N,N,N,2,&P,&Q)
                  CALL REALTR(A,A(2),N,2)

        Inverse transform

                  CALL REALTR(A,A(2),N,-2)
                  CALL dfft(A,A(2),N,N,N,-2,&P,&Q)

        ARGUMENTS 


          A          is a REAL array of dimension 2*N+2 containing the 2*n 
                     real data values or the N+1 complex coefficients.

          N          is one-half the number (which must be even) of real 
                     data values.

          &P,&Q      are as before.

2  OPERATION

     The fast Fourier transform has been thoroughly treated in the liter-
     ature and will not be reviewed here.  Suffice it to say that the 
     technique achieves computational efficiency by avoiding redundant
     computations which arise if the number, n, of samples is composite.
     The FFT offers no advantage if n is prime and large advantage if n
     is the product of many small factors.

     These programs were written by Richard C. Singleton of the Stanford 
     Research Institute.  His paper, referenced above, should be studied
     by all who have more than a superficial interest in this software.
     Much of this document is taken verbatim from his paper.

     REALTR is axactly as received from SRI, which SRI claims agrees with
     the paper.  dfft differs from what was received from SRI in the
     following repects only:

      * The name was changed from FFT.

      * The error conditions which now cause error returns used to cause
        the printing of an error message followed by termination of the
        job.

     TRANSFORMING COMPLEX DATA

     dfft computes either a single-variate complex Fourier transform
     or the calculation for one variate of a multivariate transform.

     To compute a single-variate transform
         
                        n-1
                       _____
                       \
          (alpha)(k) =  \    X(j)exp(2(PI)ijk/n)
                        /
                       /____
                        j=0

     of complex data values,

            CALL dfft(A,B,n,n,n,1,&p,&q)

     The "inverse" transform

                       n-1
                     ______
                     \
             x(j) =   \       (alpha)(k)exp(-2(PI)ijk/n)
                      /
                     /_____
                      k=0

    is computed by

           CALL dfft(A,B,n,n,n,-1,&p,&q).

    Scaling is left to the user.  The two calls in succession give 
    the transformation

           T*Tx=nx,

    i.e., n times the original values, except for round-off errors.
    The arrays A and B originally hold the ral and imaginary com-
    ponents of the data, indexed from 1 to n; the data values are 
    replaced by the complex Fourier coefficients.  Thus the real
    component of (alpha)(k) is found in A(k+1), and the imaginary
    component in B(k+1), for k=0,1...,n-1.

    The difference between the transform and inverse calculation is
    primarily one of changing the sign of a variable holding the value
    2(PI).  The one additional change is to follow an alternative
    path within the radix-4 sectin of the program, using the angle
    -(PI)/2 rather than (PI)/2.

    To compute a bivariate transform on the data stored in rectangular
    arrays A and B, the subroutine is called once to transform the
    columns and again to transform the rows.  A multivariate transform
    is essentially a single-variate transform with modified indexing.
    Multivariate data are indexed according to the Fortran array
    element successor function, without limit on the number of implied
    multiple subscripts.  The subroutine is called once for each 
    variate.  These calls may be in any order.

    Restrictions on n-values result from finite array sizes built into
    the program.  The subroutine as presented permits a maximum prime 
    factor of 23, using four arrays of this dimension.  The dimension
    of these arrays may be reduced to 1 if n contains no prime factors
    greater than 5.  An array NP(209) is used in permuting the results
    to normal order; the present value permits a maximum of 210 for the
    product of the square-free if it cannot be paired with another factor
    of p in n; i.e., each prime occurring an odd number of times in n is 
    a square-free factor, the dimension of this array can be reduced to
    j+1, where j is the maximum number of prime factors if n.  A sixth
    array NFAC(11) holds the factors of n.  This is ample for any transform
    that can be done on a computer with core storage for 2**17 REAL values
    (2**16 complex values);

                    52 488 = 2 x 3**4 x 2 x 3**4 x 2

    is the only number <2**16 with as many as 11 factors, given the 
    factoring used in this algorithm.  The existing array dimensions
    do not permit unrestricted choice of n, but they rule out only a small 
    percentage of the possible values.

    The transform portion of the subroutine includes sections for factors
    of 2, 3, 4 and 5, as well as general section for odd factors.  The
    sections for 2 and 4 include multiplication of each result value by 
    the rotation factor; combining the two steps gives bout a 10 percent 
    speed improvement over using the general rotation factor section in
    the program, due to reduced indexing.  The sections for 3 and 5 are
    similar to the general odd factors section, and they improve speed 
    substantially for these factors by reducing indexing operations.  
    The odd factors section is used for odd primes >5, burt can handle
    any odd factor.  The rotation factor section works for any factor
    but is used only for odd factors.

    The permutation for square factors of n contains special code for
    single-variate transforms, since less indexing is required.  However,
    the permutation for multivariate transforms also works on 
    single-variate transforms.

    TRANSFORMING REAL DATA

    A single-variate Fourier transform of 2n real data values can be
    computed by use of a complex Fourier transform of dimension n. Sub-
    routine REALTR provides this capability.

    The real data vlaues are stored alternately in the arrays A and B,

                    A(1),B(1),A(2),B(2),...A(n),B(n),

    then we

                    CALL dfft(A,B,n,n,n,1)
                    CALL REALTR(A,B,n,1)

    After scaling by 0.5/n, the results in A and B are the Fourier
    cosine and sine coefficients, i.e.,

                    a(k) = A(k+1)
                      
                    b(k) = B(k+1)

    for k=0,1,...,n,with b(0)=b(n)=0.  The inverse operation,

                    CALL REALTR(A,B,n,-1)
                    CALL dfft(A,B,n,n,n,-1),

    after scaling by 1/2, evaluates the Fourier series and leaves 
    the time domain values stored

                    A(1),B(1),A(2),B(2),...A(n),B(n),

    as originally.

    The subroutine REALTR, called with ISN=1*, separates the complex
    transforms of the even- and odd-numbered data values, using the
    fact that the transform of real data has the complex conjugate
    symmetry
                                              *
                     (alpha)(n-k) = (alpha)(k) 

               * ISN is the fourth (last) argument to REALTR

    for k=1,2,...,n-1, then performs a final radix-2 step to complete 
    the transform for the 2n real values.  If called with ISN = -1,
    the inverse operation is performed.  The pair of calls

                      CALL REALTR(A,B,n,1)
                      CALL REALTR(A,B,n,-1)

    return the original values multiplied by 4, except for round-off 
    errors.

    The data may alternatively be stored in a single complex array A, 
    then the magnitude of ISN changed to two to give the correct indexing
    increment and A(2) used to pass the initial address for the sequence
    of imaginary values, e.g.,

                       CALL dfft(A,A(2),n,n,n,2)
                       CALL REALTR(A,A(2),n,2)

    In this case, the cosine and sine coefficients alternate in A.

2  TIMING AND ACCURACY
   
    The subroutine dfft was tested for time and accuracy on the IPL 
    360/65 computer.  The results are shown in Table 1 below.  The times 
    areCPU times measured with 1/60 second resolution.

    The data used in the trials were random normal deviates with a mean of 
    zero and a standard deviation of one (i.e., an expected rms value of 
    one). The subroutine was called twice:

                        CALL dfft(A,B,n,n,n,1)
                        CALL dfft(A,B,n,n,n,-1);

    then the result was scaled by 1/n.  The square deviations from the 
    original data values were summed, the real and imaginary quantities
    separately, then divided by n and square roots taken to yield an rms
    error value.  The two values were in all cases comparable in magnitude,
    and an average is reported in Table 1.

    The measured times were normalized in two ways, first by dividing by

              m
              ____
           n  \    n(i),
              /___
              1-l

     and second by dividing by

              n log(2)(n).

     To a first approximation, computing time for the mixed radix FFT is
     proportional to n times the sum of the factors of n, and we observe
     in the present case that a proportionality constant of 21 (us) gives 
     a fair fit to this model.  On the basis of counting complex multi-
     plications, we would expect a decline in this proportionality constant
     with increasing radix; a decline is observed for odd primes >5.  
     Factors of 5 or less are of course favored by special coding in the 
     program.  The second normalized time value places all times on a 
     comparable scale, allowing one to assess the relative efficiency of 
     using values other than powers of 2.

     Singleton's paper provides a table listing numbers up to 100,000 
     containing no prime factor greater than 5 to aid the user in 
     selecting efficient values of n.

2  RESTRICTIONS
 
     dfft cannot be used for values of n containing prime factors >23 or
     for values of n having square-free portions >210 containing two or more
     factors or for values of n having more than 208 prime factors.  These 
     restrictions can be relaxed by increasing certain array sizes in the 
     program and recompiling.

     SIZE

         dfft uses 10132(10) bytes.  REALTR uses 1054(10) bytes.

2  EXAMPLE

     A tri-variate transform with real components in A(n1,n2,n3) and
     imaginary components in B(n1,n2,n3) is computed by

                  CALL dfft(A,B,n1*n2*n3,n1,n1,1)
                  CALL dfft(A,B,n1*n2*n3,n2,n1*n2,1)
