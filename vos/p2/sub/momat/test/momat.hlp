    SEDRNA   Flag                    0 or 1                              I*4

    SEDRNA   is a flag which defines the manner in which the north angle
             (THT) is computed.

             SEDRNA>0 specifies that THT is measured clockwise from up 
             to the northward projection of the planet spin axis onto
             the image plane.

             SEDRNA=0 specifies that THT is measured clockwise from up
             to the northward projection of the planet spin axis onto 
             the image plane after the cameras have been slewed to place
             the optical axis coincident with the planet center, i.e.,
             as in the SEDR.

             SEDRNA=0 is correct for a hand measurement of THT directly
             from an image of a planet in a picture.  In this mode
             MOMAT calls the subroutine MOMATV.

             SEDRNA>0 is correct for all THT's obtained from the SEDR.
             In this mode MOMAT calls the subroutine MOMATI.
