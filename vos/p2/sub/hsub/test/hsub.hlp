1  HSUB

     HSUB may be used to generate a cumulative histogram of byte or
     halfword arrays.

  CALLING SEQUENCE:  

     CALL HSUB( DCODE, NS, BUF, HIST, ILOW, IHIGH)

  ARGUMENTS: 

     DCODE  is the input data format code:
          = 1 for byte data, = 2 for halfword data.

     NS	    is the number of samples in array BUF.

     BUF    is an array containing the input samples.

     HIST   is an INTEGER*4 array in which the sample freqencies for
	    array BUF will be accumulated.

     ILOW   is the lowest DN in the histogram range.

     IHIGH  is the highest DN in the histogram range.

2 OPERATION

     For byte data, ILOW, and IHIGH are ignored and the histogram is as-
     sumed to have a range from 0 to 255.  For halfword data, the above
     call to HSUB is equivalent to the following FORTRAN:

            		DO 10 I = 1,NS
			K = BUFF(I)
			IF (K.LT.ILOW) K=ILOW
			IF (K.GT.IHIGH) K=IHIGH
			K = K - ILOW + 1
		   10   HIST(K) = HIST(K) + 1
    
     All input samples with DN values less than ILOW or greater than
     IHIGH are truncated.  

     If IHIGH < ILOW, then IHIGH = ILOW + 1
