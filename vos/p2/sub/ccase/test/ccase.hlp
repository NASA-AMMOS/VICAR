1 CCASE
  Perform case conversion on a string.  CCASE converts according to FLAG
  parameter.  Routine UPRCASE converts to upper case.  It is available so that
  application code may be simpler when converting to upper case.


  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL CCASE( STR, FLAG, MAX )
                  or to convert to UPPER case
                             CALL UPRCASE(STR)
  C Calling Sequence:        zccase( str, flag, max );
                  or to convert to UPPER case
                             zuprcase(str);

  Arguments:   STR  -  input/output, string to be converted:  CHARACTER data 
                       type for FORTRAN (may be a substring); for C, str does
                       not need to be null-terminated for CCASE if max >= 0,
                       but str needs to be null-terminated for zuprcase.
               FLAG  - input, integer  -  conversion flag
                         if = 1: convert lower to upper case
                         if = -1: convert upper to lower case
                         if 0 or otherwise: change case of all ascii characters
               MAX  -  input, integer  -   maximum number of characters in str.
                       However, processing will cease on encoutering a 0 (null)
                       or after the Fortran length of the CHARACTER string
                       is reached.
                       If max < 0, processing continues until a 0 (null) is
                       encountered or until the Fortran length of the 
                       CHARACTER string is reached.
                       Thus, max may be set to -1 for a Fortran CHARACTER 
                       string or a null-terminated C string.
  MAX is a REQUIRED argument. (flag and max are passed by value for zsumv.)

2 History

  Original Programmer: L. W. Kamp, 7 Febr. 1984
  Current Cognizant Programmer: Steve Pohorsky
  Source Language: C
  Ported to UNIX by Steve Pohorsky

  Revisions:
   92-12-4  ..SP....  Made portable for UNIX - converted from Fortran
                      to C to handle CHARACTER strings from both FORTRAN
                      and C.  Added zccase for C.  Since all calls to CCASE
                      were to convert to UPPER, added UPRCASE and (zuprcase for
                      C) to provide simpler interface for most cases.
2 OPERATION

  CCASE will perform the specified case conversion on bytes that are ascii
  representations of letters, starting at the location specified by STR.
  CCASE calls zccase, which uses the C run-time routines toupper and
  tolower.  (Thus it might work on non-ASCII machines.)  Writing a lower case
  companion to UPRCASE would make a good training experience for a new
  programmer.
