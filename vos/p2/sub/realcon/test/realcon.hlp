1 REALCON

 This routine will convert a REAL*4 number, R, to exactly fill an
 N-character field in BUF in external format. It will convert R to
 Fixed-point format unless not enough characters are available, in
 which case Floating point (exponential) format is used.

  Fortran Calling Sequence:  CALL REALCON( R, BUF, N)

  Arguments: R (real*4) -   number to be converted
             BUF -          character variable to contain external 
                            representation of R.
             N (integer*4) -number of characters in BUF to contain 
                             the representation of R.

2 Operation

 REALCON uses the Fortran WRITE statement with a run-time format.
 (REALCON is callable from Fortran.)  The routine will convert a
 number to fixed-point format if the field size is large enough,
 else it will convert to floating point format.


 E.g., the number 1.285E+06 will be converted to:

                1285000.00

 if N=10 is specified, but to:

                1.28E+6

 if N=7 is specified.

 The routine executes a number of instructions for each number, including
 up to two logarithms, plus whatever is inside the WRITEs, so it is
 not recommended for heavy-duty processing.
