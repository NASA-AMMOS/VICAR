1  PPROJ

A FORTRAN and C callable routine which transforms coordinates from 
object space (line,sample) to (latitude,longitude) and vice-versa.

  Fortran Calling Sequence:
      CALL PPROJ(MAP,LINE,SAMP,LAT,LON,MODE,ILAT,RADIUS,SRANGE,IND)

  C Calling Sequence: 
      zpproj(map,&line,&samp,&lat,&lon,mode,ilat,&radius,&srange,&ind);
    Note the & for all scalar arguments except mode and ilat, denoting the 
    passing by address.

2  ARGUMENTS

      MAP        is the standard 40-word geometry buffer (see subroutine
                 CONVEV), R*4.

      LINE,SAMP  is the object space location of a point, R*4.

      LAT,LON    are the planetary coordinates of the point, R*4.
                 Longitude is degrees West, Latitude is in degrees,
                 either planetodetic or planetocentric, depending on
                 ILAT.

      MODE       1 = (LAT,LON) to (LINE,SAMP) I*4
                 2 = (LINE,SAMP) to (LAT,LON) 

      ILAT       0 = planetocentric latitudes
	         1 = planetodetic latitudes

      RADIUS     is the distance from planet center to the intercept point
                 of the line of sight with the planet surface.  If the point
                 falls off the planet then it is the tangent radius to the
                 line of sight from planet center.   Note that in this case,
                 LAT,LON are computed assuming this radius instead of the 
                 one in MAP(26).
                 This parameter is ignored when MODE=1.

      SRANGE     is the distance from the spacecraft to the intercept point
                 of the line of sight with the planet surface.  If the point
                 falls off the planet then it is the distance to the tangent 
                 to the tangent point defined under RADIUS for this case.
                 This parameter is ignored when MODE=1.

      IND        Return indicator.  1=success, 0=failure.

If MODE=1, IND=0 if the input (lat,lon) coordinates are on the back side of
the planet.

If MODE=2, IND=0 if the input (line,samp) coordinates are off the planet.

2  OPERATION

PPROJ uses a perspective projection model of the camera system to transform
coordinates from object space (line,sample) to (latitude,longitude) and
vice-versa. The transformation uses the OM-matrix stored in the 40-word
geometry buffer and assumes an oblate spheroid model of the planet.  PPROJ
performs the same function as IPPCOV and CORCAV.  However, it also returns
the distances from the point viewed on the planet to the spacecraft and
planet center (SRANGE and RADIUS parameters).

When computing latitude/longitude (MODE=2), an additional feature is provided
when the point falls off the planet:  in this case the routine computes the
value that the radius would need to have in order to make the line of sight 
just tangent to the surface and returns this to the caller.  The routine also 
returns the lat/long of this tangent point.  However, note that IND=0 for this 
case, so by default these returned values should be ignored;  they are provided 
in order to enable the user to project off-limb data for certain projections.
