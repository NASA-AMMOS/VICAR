1 SCET_UPDATE

SCET_UPDATE is designed to assist in detect and/or correct invalid
Spacecraft Event Time (SCET) and Earth Receive Time (ERT) in a SPICE 
data buffer.  It does so by invoking DATE_CHECK subroutines to detect 
invalid date format.  For VGR-1 and VGR-2, the subroutine will attempt 
to convert the 2-digit year input into 4-digit using 100-year sliding 
window.  It also sets the MSEC field to 0, because this field is set to 
-999 for Voyager.

Design Logics:

   For SCET check and update:
      IF scet is not NULL (i.e. -999) THEN
         IF invalid scet format THEN
            IF project is Voyager THEN
               use 75 as the switch for 100-year window to update scet
               IF still has invalid format THEN
                  ABEND
            ELSE
              ABEND
      ELSE
         ABEND

   For ERT check and update:
      Same as SCET check and update, but it will not ABEND if the input
      date is NULL.


FORTRAN calling sequence:

   CHARACTER*5 PROJECT
   INTEGER*4 DATA[80] ! GETLABCON buffer. 
   INTEGER*4 IND  !return status = 1 when successful

   ...
   CALL SCET_UPDATE (PROJECT,DATA,IND)
   ...


C calling sequence:

   char project[5];
   int  data[80];  /* zgetlabcon buffer */
   int  ind;  /* return status = 1 when successful */

   ...
   ind = zscet_update (project,data);
   ...
