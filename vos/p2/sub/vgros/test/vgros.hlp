1 VGROS

  Routine to fetch the Voyager object space reseau locations for
  a specified camera.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL VGROS(ICAM,OLOC)

      INTEGER*4 ICAM       Input Voyager camera serial number.
      REAL*4 OLOC(2,202)   Output object space reseau locations stored
		           as (line,sample) pairs.

  C Calling Sequence:  zvgros(icam,oloc)

      int icam;            Input Voyager camera serial number.
      float oloc(202,2)    Output object space reseau locations stored
		           as (line,sample) pairs.

  The Voyager camera serial numbers are:
	4 = VGR-1 WA		6 = VGR-2 WA
	5 = VGR-1 NA		7 = VGR-2 NA
 
  NOTE: Two-dimensional (or higher) arrays can be a major problem, since
        Fortran treats things in column-major order, while C uses row-major
        order.  Therefore, the C array dimensions need to be reversed.
