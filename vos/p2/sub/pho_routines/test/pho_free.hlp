VICAR SUBROUTINE			phoFree
================================================================================

Purpose:				To release memory which was previously 
					allocated for a photometric function 
					data object.

================================================================================

Function:				Deallocates memory for the pointer to 
					the photometric structure using free().
					The structure was previously allocated 
					by phoInit.

================================================================================

Requirements and Dependencies:

Libraries and subroutines
required to run routine:		none

Necessary include files
for calling routine 
or program:				pho.h (for C routines )
					pho.fin (for FORTRAN routines )

Main programs from which 
subroutine will be called:		general application software

Other requirements: 			need to run routine phoInit first

================================================================================

Interfaces: Input / Output Parameters:

Calling Sequence:		

	calling from C			include "pho.h"
					PHO PHO_DATA;
					int status;
					...
					status = phoFree( PHO_DATA );

	calling from FORTRAN		INCLUDE 'pho'
					INTEGER PHO_DATA, STATUS
					...
					call pho_free( PHO_DATA, status ) 


Parameters:
	
	Name		Type		In/Out		Description
	
	PHO_DATA	PHO_STRUCT	Input		Address of photometric 
							function data object

	status	int			Output		Error status:
							phoSUCCESS - success
