1 ADDV

  ADDV is a general routine for adding arrays.  

 Fortran calling sequence:  CALL ADDV(DCODE, N, A, B, INCA, INCB)
 C Calling Sequence:        zaddv(dcode, n, a, b, inca, incb);
 
  INCA and INCB are REQUIRED arguments. (dcode, n, inca, and incb are
  passed by value for zaddv.)

  Arguments:

    DCODE  (input, integer)           data format code
    N      (input, integer)           number of elements
    A      (input, DCODE data type)   first input array
    B      (in/out, DCODE data type)  second input/output array
    INCA   (input, integer)           A increment
    INCB   (input, integer)           B increment

2 Operation

  ADDV is a general routine for adding arrays.  Array B is 
  replaced with the sum of A and B.  Arrays A and B can be
  of different data types as indicated by DCODE.
  
2 Arguments 

    DCODE   data types    =1    A is byte           B is byte
                          =2    A is halfword       B is halfword
                          =3    A is byte           B is halfword
                          =4    A is fullword       B is fullword
                          =5    A is byte           B is fullword
                          =6    A is halfword       B is fullword
                          =7    A is real (single)  B is real
                          =8    A is double         B is double
                          =9    A is real           B is double

                          negative values -1 to -9 are reverse of above

    N       Number of elements on which operation will be performed
    A       First input array
    B       Second input array; also contains the output (sum of A and B)
    INCA    Address increment in array A
    INCB    Address increment in array B

 REVISION HISTORY:                                          
   11-92    ..SP....  Made portable for UNIX - Adapted from ASU version.
                      Added zaddv for calls from C.  Changed name from
                      add to addv (added v for most of the vector routines).
                      ELIMINATED OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR PORTABILITY.
