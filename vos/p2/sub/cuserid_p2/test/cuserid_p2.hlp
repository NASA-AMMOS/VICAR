1 CUSERID_P2

  Routine to return the current process' user ID as a string.  Just like
  cuserid() but portable to all systems (some don't implement cuserid()).

  C Calling Sequence:  strcpy(buf, cuserid_p2());

  The returned string must be copied or used before calling this routine
  again... it is NOT reentrant.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence: N/A

  Fortran bridge not implemented yet.
