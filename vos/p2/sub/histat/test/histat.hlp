1 histat,histat2

Given the histogram, subroutines histat and histat2 compute the mean and
standard-deviation of a byte and halfword image, respectively.  histat2
will also return the minimum and maximum DN value in the image.

Calling Sequence:

    CALL histat(HIS,NPTS,mean,sigma,maxfreq)
    CALL histat2(HIS2,NPTS,mean,sigma,mindn,maxdn,maxfreq)
where
    INTEGER*4 HIS(256) is the histogram of the byte image (input).
    INTEGER*4 HIS2(65536) is the histogram of the halfword image (input).
    INTEGER*4 NPTS is the number of pixels in the image (input).
    REAL*4 MEAN,SIGMA are the output mean and standard-deviation.
    INTEGER*4 MINDN,MAXDN are the output minimum and maximum DN.
    INTEGER*4 MAXFREQ is the maximum frequency in HIS or HIS2, excluding
       the end-points (0 and 255 DN or -32768 and 32767 DN).

2 OPERATION

HIS2 must extend of the full halfword DN range (i.e. HIS2(1) must be
the sample frequency at -32768 DN and HIS(65536) must be the sample
frequency at +32767 DN).

If the number of pixels in the image, NPTS, is zero, then the mean, standard
deviation and maximum frequency are set to zero, (MEAN, SIGMA, MAXFREQ).  
The output minimum and maximum DNs for histat2 are set to 32767.
