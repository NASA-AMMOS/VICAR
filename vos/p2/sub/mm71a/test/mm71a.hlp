2  Calling Sequence:  

     CALL MM71A(BUF)

2  PURPOSE

       To provide the calling program a buffer containing nominal Mariner 9
       distortion correction data in GEOMA format.


2  OPERATION

       The data in the array is similar to the format as the parameter 
       dataset which can be input to GEOMA.  The difference between the
       two formats is in the first word.  This subroutine begins with NAH
       and the first word in the GEOMA dataset is the number of words (840)
       following the first word.


2  ARGUMENTS


    CALL MM71A(BUF)

      where:  

       BUF is an 840 word array of GEOMA parameters returned.

       MM71A should be called to get data for the "A: camera and MM71b for
       the "B" camera.
