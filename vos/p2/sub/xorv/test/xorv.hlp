1  XORV

2  PURPOSE

	General routine for "xor"-ing arrays.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

 Fortran calling sequence:  CALL XORV(DCODE, N, A, B, INCA, INCB)
 C Calling Sequence:        zxorv(dcode, n, a, b, inca, incb);
 
  INCA and INCB are REQUIRED arguments. (dcode, n, inca, and incb are
  passed by value for zxorv.)


  Arguments:

    DCODE  (input, integer)           data format code (See below.)
    N      (input, integer)           number of elements
    A      (input, DCODE data type)   first input array
    B      (in/out, DCODE data type)  second input array and output array
             On output B(i) = XOR(B(i),A(i))   [i=1,..,N] for case of 
                                                          INCA=1=INCB.
    INCA   (input, integer)           A array index increment
    INCB   (input, integer)           B array index increment

	DCODE      Data types

                   ..INPUT..         ..OUTPUT..

                   =1,   A is byte         B is byte
                   =2,   A is halfword     B is halfword
                   =3,   A is byte         B is halfword
                   =4,   A is fullword     B is fullword
                   =5,   A is byte         B is fullword
                   =6,   A is halfword     B is fullword
                   negative values -1 to -6 reverse of above

2  HISTORY

        Original Programmer: Lucas Kamp, 83-7-4
        Current Cognizant Programmer: Steve Pohorsky
        Source Language: C
        Ported to UNIX:       Steve Pohorsky 3-30-93

 REVISION HISTORY:                                          
   3-30-93  ..SP....  Made portable for UNIX - Adapted from mulv.
                      Added zxorv for calls from C.  Changed name from
                      xor to xorv (added v for most of the vector routines).
                      ELIMINATED OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR PORTABILITY.
                      Replaced test program for portability.
2 OPERATION

        Array B is replaced with XOR(A,B). A and B can be of 
        different data types as indicated.

  The calling sequence:

       CALL XORV(DCODE, N, A, B, INCA, INCB)

  Is equivalent to the following code:


       I = 1
       J = 1
       DO K=1,N
          B(J) = ieor( B(J),A(I))
          I    = I + INCA
          J    = J + INCB
       ENDDO

  Where all arguments are INTEGER, except for the arrays whose
  data types are controlled by the data code DCODE.
