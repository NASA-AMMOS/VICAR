There are 3 test programs included for this module:
	tst_chdo_base
	tst_sclk_time
    &	tst_sfoc_time

The two time programs (sclk & sfoc) are self contained and just need to be
executed.  They run through checks for most of the available capabilities
and error detection code.  They are success oriented and will notify on
errors.  One quick note regarding the time routines, they work correctly
up until December 31, 2100, after that they start failing.  The tests go
beyond that date, so expect errors at that point.

The CHDO test program is a simple SFDU parser that extracts the basic
components of the CHDO headers from any SFDU.  It will identify all CHDOs
it parses and its length.  If the SFDU file continas CHDOs 82 & 128, a few
fields from each CHDO will be displayed.  No SFDU file is provided, as any
will work.  Bear in mind that there are typically 5 CHDOs per SFDU record,
so the output generated from this program can be large.  The program takes
one arguement, the SFDU file name.
