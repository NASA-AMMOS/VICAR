1  RFT2

     RFT2 computes a transform of a doubly-subscripted array of real numbers
     or an inverse transform whose result is such an array.  The transform
     is similar to a Fourier transform except that the redundant Fourier 
     coefficients resulting from the fact that the data are real are not
     computed nor is space provided for them in the transform format.  This 
     results in nearly a factor of two savings in space requirements and
     also a savings in computer time as compared with a complex Fourier
     transform.

                             -2 : one of the square-free factors of the 
                                  matrix dimensions is too large.
                             -1 : one of the dimensions of the input matrix

                             * * *

     The array dimensions required for an m-line, n-sample transform are 
     provided in Fortran with

                 REAL A(n,m+2).

     The number of lines, m, must be even.  To compute the transform

                 CALL RFT2(A,M,N,1,STATUS).

     The initial content of the last two lines is immaterial.  In the
     resulting transform, adjacent pairs of real lines may be considered
     to be single lines of complex numbers with their real parts
     appearing in the first line of the pair and corresponding imaginary
     parts in the second.   The first and last complex lines correspond
     to vertical dc and maximum frequency and exhibit conjugate symmetry
     in the sample direction.  The whole may be viewed as the upper half
     of the full complex Fourier transform with dc in the upper left
     corner.

     To compute the inverse transform of an array initially in this format
     (conjugate symmetry in first and last complex lines),

                 CALL RFT2(A,M,N,-1,STATUS).

     The resulting array of real numbers fills the first m lines of A.
     The last two lines of A should be ignored.  Scaling is such that the 
     successive use of the two transforms multiplies everything by 2.m.n.

     In both the forward and the inverse cases, the alternate returns are
     caused by various problems with factoring M or N.

2  OPERATION


     RFT2 uses existing general purpose mixed-radix fast Fourier transform
     routines RCSFFT and REALTR.  The reader is directed to the documenta-
     tion for these subroutines for details such as range of acceptable
     line and sample counts and dependence of timing on these values.

     Given the general purpose tools RCSFFT and REALTR, completing the 
     description of RFT@ is largely a matter of defining data formats.
     The subscript conventions used to describe these formats are as
     follows:

        o  When using a subscript (x,y) in an algebraic expression, we
           associate the first component, x, with line number increasing 
           downward and the second, y, with sample number increasing to 
           the right.  This provides a right-handed coordinate system
           which is consistent with image processing practice.

        o  It is image processing convention that, when an image is
           stored on a secondary storage medium such as disk or tape,
           consecutive locations on the secondary medium are occupied
           by consecutive samples in a given line of the image, with
           consecutive lines following one another.  From a performance
           point of view, it is essential to preserve the adjacency of
           samples within a line in the main store representatin of
           images as well, at least in arrays that are used as input/
           output buffers.  This means that if Fortran double subscript-
           ing is used to address such an array, sample must correspond
           to the first Fortran subscript and line to the second because
           of the USA Standard Array Element Successor Function of 
           Fortran.  This places the Fortran subscripts in the opposite
           order from the "right-handed" convention above.

        o  Finally, in Fourier-transform work, it is most natural to con-
           sider the subscript of an n-element array as ranging over 
           0,1,2,...,n-1.  However, USA Standard Fortran requires that
           Fortran subscripts be positive, thereby excluding zero.
           Therefore, a consistent difference of 1 occurs in this document
           between subscripts appearing in Fortran expressions and the
           corresponding subscripts appearing elsewhere.

3 MATHEMATICAL_DEFINITION

      The function of RFT2 may be defined as follows.  Let m and n be the 
      number of lines and samples, respectively, in the signal (image)
      array.  m must be even and, in addition, both m and n must meet
      the factorability criteria defined in the "restrictions" paragraph.

      Let {f(jk)},j=0,1,2,...,m-1;k=0,1,2,...,n-1 be the signal (image)
      array and {g(jk)},j=0,1,2,...,m/2; k=0,1,...,n-1 be the transform
      array.  Each f(jk) is a real number and each g(jk) is a complex
      number.  Note that the number of lines in {g} is one-half that
      in {f}, plus one.

      The forward transform

                     CALL RFT2(f,m,n,1,&x,&y,&x)

      causes f to overlaid by g, where

                    m-1    n-1
                    _____  _____
         g(jk) = 2  \      \     f(pq)exp( 2(PI)ijp/m + 2(PI)ikq/n ).
                    /____  /____ 
                    p=0    q=0

      Note that the first and last lines of g exhibit conjugate symmetry 
      in the sample direction, i.e.,
                       
         g(0k) = g*(0,n-k),k=1,2,...,n-1; g(00) = g*(00)
      and                                                                 
         g(m/2,k) = g*(m/2),(n-k),k=1,2,...,n-1; g*(m/2,0) = g*(m/2,0).

      For any m/2 - 1 xn complex array g having conjugate symmetry in the 
      first and last lines, the inverse transform 

                           CALL RFT2(g,m,n,-1,&x,&y,&z)
                                
      causes g to e overlaid by f, where

                    m 
                    - _ 1
                    2       n-1
                    -----   -----
          f(jk) =   \       \        g(pq)exp( -2(PI)ijp/m - 2(PI)ikq/n )
                    /____   /____
                    p=0     q=0

      
                 m-1     n-1
                 -----   -----                   
              +  \       \       g*(m-p,q)exp( -2(PI)ijp/m + 2(PI)ikq/n )
                 /____   /____  
                     m   q=0
                 p = -
                     2
                  
       f is real.  If g was obtained by taking the forward RFT2 transform 
       of an array F, then scaling is such that

                 f = 2mnF

3 ERROR_RETURNS

       The significance of the three error returns, &x, &y,and &z, is the
       same in both the forward and inverse cases.  Control is tranferred
       to the corresponding statement numbers in the caller's program as
       follows:

              x - A prime factor of m or n exceeds 23;

              y - The square-free portion of m/2 or n has two or more
                  factors and exceeds 210, or, the number of prime factors
                  of m/2 or n exceeds 208;

              z - m is odd.

3 TRANSFORM_FORMAT

       The following array illustrates the signal and transform formats,
       i.e., the arrangement of the elements in memory, for the case m=4,
       n=3.  Each square corresponds to one machine word.  The four 
       notations in each square are:

        |________________|________________|________________|

       (It might be noted that there is at least one natural fromat that
       might have been used instead.  Roughly stated, the alternative
       format has the role of line and sample reversed so that the left
       half, rather than the upper half, of the full complex transform
       is retained.  This format has the advantage that the real and 
       imaginary parts of each complex element of the transform are ad-
       jacent in memory, thereby enabling the complex number to be refer-
       enced as such.  It has the disadvantage however, that the extra
       space required for the transform is not added on at the end, but
       requires two extra words in each line; this difference of two,
       unlike that in the line direction, can not be suppressed and will
       propagate up to the highest level routine utilizing the array, at
       each stage triggering mental gymnastics and probably, arithmetic
       performed on the array dimensions.  In addition to these clear
       pros and cons, two other tradoffs occur which are a priori neutral:
       First, the "even restriction" shifts from the line direction to
       the sample direction.  Second, the storage required for the RFT2
       format is n(m+2) while that required for the alternative is
       m(n+2); if m and n are not equal, the total space requirement is 
       different.)

       (RFT2 is a very small piece of code.  The user interested in the
       alternative format should have little trouble coding it up for
       himself, using RFT2 as a guide.)

3 TIMING

       For other than the smallest values of m or n, the bulk of the time
       spent by RFT2 is in RCSFFT, with small amounts also going to REALTR.
       In both the froward and inverse modes, RFT2 makes n calls to RCSFFT
       with RCSFFT N=m/2, m/2 calls on RCSFFT with RCSFFT N=n, and n calls
       on REALTR with REALTR N=m/2.  The timings for RCSFFT and REALTR may 
       be obtained from the related document.  The time for RCSFFT may be 
       roughly approximated as 20 micro sec X n.sum(n(i)), where the n(i)
       are the prime factors of n.  Thus both m and n should be highly 
       composite numbers if possible.

3 RESTRICTIONS
             
       The number of lines, m, must be even.  In addition, both (m/2) and n
       must meet the restrictions of RCSFFT.  The are that no prime factor
       may exceed 23, that if the square-free portion has two or more
       factors, it may not exceed 210, and that the number of prime factors
       may not exceed 208.  The RCSFFT restrictions may be relaxed by
       changing certain array sizes and recompiling; see the document.

3 EXAMPLE

       The following subroutine computs the cyclic convolution of F and X
       and saves the result in X:

			SUBROUTINE CONV2(F,X,M,N,*)
			DIMENSION F(N,M),X(N,M)
			CALL RFT2(F,M,N,1,*3,*4,*5)
			CALL RFT2(X,M,N,1)
			M2 = M+2
			S = 1. / (4*M*N)
			DO 2 J = 2,M2,2
			DO 1 K = 1,N
 
		   C  REPLACE ONE COMPLEX ELEMENT OF THE TRANSFORM OF

		   C  X WITH THE APPROPRIATELY SCALED PRODUCT OF CORRESPONDING

		   C  ELEMENTS OF F AND X. . .

				T	= S*(F(K,J-1)*X(K,J-1) - F(K,J)*X(K,J))
				X(K+J)  = S*(F(K,J-1)*X(K,J) + F(K,J)*X(K,J-1))
				X(K,J-1)=T
			1	CONTINUE
			2	CONTINUE	
				CALL RFT2 (X,M,N,-1)
				RETURN
			3	CONTINUE
			4	CONTINUE
			5	CONTINUE
				RETURN 1
				END

       This subroutine was coded up as an exercise and compared against a 
       "brute-force" convolution routine, also in Fortran, using 64x64
       arrays.  The RMS difference in the answers was less than 10E-5 times
       the RMS of the element values.  The brute-force routine took 71.77
       CPU seconds; CONV2 took 1.07 CPU seconds.
