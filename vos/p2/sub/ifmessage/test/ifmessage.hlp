1 IFMESSAGE

  Display a message unless the the TAE NOMESSAGE flag was set (with
  FLAG-ADD NOMESSAGE).  This may be done, for example, to display the
  program version unless NOMESSAGE is set.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  call ifmessage( msg )
  C Calling Sequence:        zifmessage( msg );

  The argument msg is REQUIRED. 
  In Fortran, it must be a quoted string or CHARACTER type.
  In C, it must be a quoted string or any other null-terminated string.

  IFMESSAGE calls XVP to check the bit of the TAE global variable $switch
  that is the NOMESSAGE flag.  If the bit is not set, it calls XVMESSAGE to 
  print the message.  (See the VICAR online help for FLAG for info on the flag.)
