1 CMPR
  For the port to UNIX, calls to CMPR will mostly, if not always, be replaced
  with (expression1 .EQ. expression2) where the expressions may be character
  variables, character constants, character substrings, or other character
  expressions.  It is being ported in case any programs really need to
  compare BYTE arrays.

  The function subprogram CMPR compares two byte arrays,
  X and Y, of length N.  It returns .TRUE. if they are
  identical, and .FALSE. if they are not equal.

 From C, use ANSI C routine memcmp, or use strcmp or strncmp for strings.


  Usage:  L = CMPR(X,Y,N)

  X and Y are the starting addresses of the two BYTE
  arrays to be compared.  N is the number of 
  bytes to be compared.  N must be an INTEGER*4 variable.
