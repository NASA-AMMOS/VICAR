1 get_seconds

  Return current date and time expressed as the number of seconds elapsed since
  GMT 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, as long as number of seconds are less then
  2**31. If number of seconds exceeds 2**31-1, get_seconds will return number
  of seconds minus 2**31. This change is legitimate, since the sole usage of
  this function is to obtain a random seed and not time, this change should
  not effect functionality of progrmas using it.  get_seconds was developed
  to provide a portable Fortran interface to obtain the current time as a
  random seed for programs like fracgen which use current time to randomize
  the random number generator.
  This subroutine is callable only from Fortran.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL get_seconds( SEC_OF_TIME )

  Arguments: INTEGER*4 SEC_OF_TIME   ouput integer.
             Seconds of elapsed time since GMT 00:00:00 on 1-JAN-1970.
