1 SEARC_DISTOR

 This routine searches the entire label of a VICAR image in order to
 determine whether it is "Object space" (perspective projection) or
 "Image space" (contains camera-specific distortion).  Both cases
 imply that no map labels are present, so it should be called only
 after verifying that the image does not contain map labels (using
 MP_LABEL_READ or SEARCV2).  Note that SEARCV2 (on the unported
 system) performs the same function, but the current version does
 not work for certain kinds of (very old) VICAR labels.

2 Calling Sequence

 CALL SEARC_DISTOR( UNIT, IND)

 UNIT (input, integer) = unit number assigned by XVUNIT

 IND (output, integer) = indicator flag:
      IND=0 means Image space
      IND=1 means Object space
      IND=-1: label exceeds buffer size
      IND=-2: error reading label

2 Operation

 Currently, the criteria for determining that an unlabelled image
 is Obect space are that it has been processed by a GEOM task or by
 FARENC.  Thus, all that SEARC_DISTOR does is to search the entire
 label buffer for these strings.
