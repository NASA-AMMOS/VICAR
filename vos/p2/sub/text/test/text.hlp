1 Text

  Fortran:
     integer inchr, line, size, dn
     character*inchr inbuf
     byte outbuf(inchr*size)
     call text(inbuf, inchr, line, outbuf, size, dn)

  C:
     int inchr, line, size, dn;
     char inbuf[];
     unsigned char outbuf[];
     text(inbuf, inchr, line, outbuf, size, dn);

  This is a text image generating routine, used to convert a string of text
  into a dot matrix array.

  Each character is stored as a 7 line by 5 sample matrix.  To generate a
  text image, TEXT must be called 7 times--once for each image line needed.
  Each output buffer also includes a blank space between each character,
  so you should actually allow for 6 samples per character in your output
  buffer.

  Frankly, this isn't a particularly intelligent program and you must be
  careful to call it correctly.  It is your responsibility to allocate both
  the input and output buffers, and your responsibility to maintain the line
  number count as you generate the 7 lines of the character string.  You
  must also set the size parameter correctly.  For normal character size,
  the size parameter = 6.  For magnified character size, see below.

  This subroutine provides an option to generate larger size text by an
  integer magnification factor.  Unfortunately, the subroutine is still
  pretty stupid about this--you're not allowed to just pass in the mag-
  nification factor.  You have to multiply your magnification factor by
  6 (6 samples per character, counting the space that separates each char-
  acter) and pass that figure in using the size parameter.  You will also
  have to make sure that you have allocated enough space in your output
  buffer to handle the increased size.  This subroutine will handle expand-
  ing each line, but your program will have to repeat each line according
  to the magnification factor you have specified.

  Finally, the dn parameter used to be optional.  Now that the program has
  been ported to Unix, it's a required parameter.  If you set it to 0, the
  subroutine will use a default value of 255 for the dn--otherwise, it will
  use the value you specify.

  Input Parameters:
     inbuf  -- the array of ASCII characters to be converted
     inchr  -- the number of characters to be converted
     line   -- the line number to be generated (0-6)
     size   -- =6 for standard char size.  6*n for multiple size chars
     dn     -- DN value of the output characters

  Output Parameters:
     outbuf -- the output array.  It must be at least inchr*size bytes long
