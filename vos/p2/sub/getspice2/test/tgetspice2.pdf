PARAMETERS FOR RETRIEVING CAMERA POINTING FROM SPICE:

The following parameters permit the user to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing from the SPICE kernels:

SPICEMODE specifies whether SPICE data is retrieved from LOCAL kernels or
or via the REMOTE SPICE server.  If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value
of the environmental variable DEFAULTSPICE.

CKNAME and CKID are alternative ways to specify the C kernel to be used.  For
example, CKNAME=FARE or CKID=M904 specifies that MIPS_FARENC.CK is to be used.
When specified, the CKID parameter overrides the CKNAME parameter.  If the
camera pointing data is not found in the requested C kernel, the other C kernels
are searched.

Within a given C kernel, there may be a number of different versions of camera
pointing for a given image.  The segment identifier for each version contains
provenance information identifying the creator of the pointing data.  One or
more of the following parameters may be used to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing based upon this provenance information:

CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
PROGRAM identifies the program which created the camera pointing.
SPKID identifies the SP-kernel used to create the camera pointing.
USERID identifies the user who created the camera pointing.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

A complete list of CK and SPK IDs are located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

The above parameters are optional, and if defaulted (or if no data is found for
the requested version), the program will attempt to locate the "best" data
available for the given image.  See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode)
for further details.

Examples:  'LOCAL CKNAME=NAIF specifies that SPICE data be retrieved from
          local kernels using camera pointing from predicts or AACS telemetry.

           'REMOTE CKNAME=FARE INSTITUTE=MIPS SPKID=N015 USERID=ADC retrieves
          the camera pointing created by Amy Culver at MIPS using the SP kernel
          GLL_LONG_2.BSP from file MIPS_FARENC.CK via the SPICE server.  (whew!)

It takes longer to search for SPICE data on the basis of provenance
information.  If all provenance parameters are specified, for example, the
program first searches through all the C kernels for an exact match.  If no
match is found, the search is relaxed by removing the CDATE criteria.  If no
match is found, the REQNUM criteria is removed.  Etc.

Optional 4-char string
SP kernel for created camera pointing
.VARI REQNUM
Optional 4-char string
IPL request number for created camera pointing
.VARI CDATE
Optional 12-char string

.LEVEL2
.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  If defaulted, the target
name is extracted from the VICAR label or determined by other TBD means.

A complete list of valid target names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.  Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode,
the other mode is attempted.

.VARI CKNAME
CKNAME is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used:

  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  --------      -------------
  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  NAIF		the best NAIF kernel is used

If defaulted, the kernels are searched in the above order.

.VARI CKID
CKID is an alternative way to specify the prefered C-kernel (see CKNAME
parameter):

  CKID	  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  ----	  --------      -------------
  M906	  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  M905	  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  M904	  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  M903	  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  M902	  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  M901	  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  varies  NAIF		there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, CKID overrides the CKNAME parameter.

.VARI USERID
USERID is a three character string which identifies the user who created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  USERID=HBM identifies Helen Mortensen as the creator of the camera
     pointing.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group which created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which created
the camera pointing.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=MIPS specifies that MIPS created the camera pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI PROGRAM
PROGRAM is the first six characters of the program creating the camera pointing.

Ex:  PROGRAM=FARENC specifies that FARENC created the camera pointing.

.VARI SPKID
SPKID specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
SP kernel used to create the camera pointing.  The SP-kernel IDs are located
in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable)
KERNELDB.

Ex:  SPKID=N015 specifies the SP kernel GLL_LONG_2.BSP

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.

Ex:  REQNUM=3456 identifies (somewhat) request number R123456

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.
