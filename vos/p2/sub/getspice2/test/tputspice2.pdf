LOCAL AND REMOTE SPICE ACCESS:

SPICE data may be retrieved and stored from SPICE kernels stored locally
or remotely (e.g. at JPL).  Remote access is via a SPICE server.

SPICEMODE specifies whether local or remote SPICE access is to be used.
If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value of the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE.


PARAMETERS FOR RETRIEVING THE INITIAL CAMERA POINTING:

Initial camera pointing data is first retrieved from predict C kernels or
from MIPS C kernels.  The following optional parameters permit the user to
specify where this initial pointing is retrieved:

CKNAME and CKID are alternative ways to specify the C kernel from which camera
pointing is to be retrieved.  For example, CKNAME=FARE or CKID=M904 specifies
that the camera pointing should be retrieved from the file MIPS_FARENC.CK.
The CKID is the unique kernel ID assigned to each C kernel.  When CKID is
specified, it overrides the CKNAME parameter.  A complete list
of kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or
environmental variable) KERNELDB.


PARAMETERS FOR STORING THE IMPROVED CAMERA POINTING:

The following optional parameters are used to store provenance information along
with the improved (C-Smithed) camera pointing computed by the program.  This
provenance information is stored in the (C kernel) segment identifier for the
camera pointing data.  In cases where there are several versions of camera
pointing for an image in a given C kernel, this provenance information can
later be used to retrieve a specific instance of camera pointing from the
kernel.

PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode) for further details.

Examples:  'LOCAL CKNAME=NAIF specifies that SPICE data be retrieved from
          local kernels using camera pointing from predicts or AACS telemetry.
          Improved camera pointing will later be stored in the local C kernel
          specific to this program.

           'REMOTE INSTITUTE=DLR USERID=TYR retrieves SPICE data remotely
          (from MIPS) via the SPICE server.  When improved camera pointing is
          stored (at MIPS), provenance data regarding the facility (DLR) and
          user (Thomas Roatsch) who created the data is included.

.LEVEL2
.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  A complete list of valid
target names is located in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or
environmental variable) BODY_IDS.
If defaulted, the target is retrieved from the VICAR label or other TBD means.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be accessed from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be accessed
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.

Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode, the other mode
is attempted in order to retrieve SPICE data.  However, when improved camera
pointing data is stored, only the specified or default mode is used.

.VARI CKNAME
CKNAME is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used in reading
camera pointing data:

  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  --------      -------------
  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  NAIF		the best NAIF kernel is used

If defaulted, the kernels are searched in the above order.

.VARI CKID
CKID is an alternative way to specify the prefered C-kernel for reading
camera pointing data (see CKNAME parameter):

  CKID	  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  ----	  --------      -------------
  M906	  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  M905	  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  M904	  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  M903	  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  M902	  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  M901	  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  varies  NAIF		there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, CKID overrides the CKNAME parameter.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which creates
the improved (C-Smithed) camera pointing.  If defaulted, the value of the
logical name (or environmental variable) VICAR_SITE is used.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=ASU identifies ASU as the creator of the improved camera
     pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.  REQNUM must contain exactly 4 digits.

Ex:  REQNUM=0123 identifies (somewhat) request number R000123

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.
The date string must contain exactly 12 digits.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.

If defaulted, the current date and time is used.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group of the user
running this program to store improved camera pointing.  (The user ID is
automatically determined by the program).

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

On VMS, this parameter is ignored since the program automatically determines
the group ID of the current user.

If GROUPID is defaulted on Unix, the program uses the value of the
environmental variable GROUPID.  Note that GROUPID is not a system-defined
variable, and should be defined in your .cshrc as in the following example:

Ex:  setenv GROUPID 040
.end
