1 ASTRCH

  ASTRCH is a UNIX-ported, FORTRAN and C callable subroutine for determining 
  the linear stretch limits of a picture which will saturate a specifiable
  percentage of the pixels at the low and high end of its histogram.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:

	CALL ASTRCH(H,LOWDN,HIGHDN,LPER,HPER,NLEV)

	INTEGER*4 H(NLEV)	Input histogram
	INTEGER*4 LOWDN,HIGHDN  Output stretch limits
	REAL*4 LPER,HPER	Low and high percent saturation (input)
        INTEGER*4 NLEV		Number of levels in histogram (input)

  C Calling Sequence:
        
        zastrch(*his,*lowdn,*highdn,lper,hper,nlev);
        
        void   his;    /* input histogram; 1D array of int  (input) */
        int    lowdn;  /* output low-end stretch limit      (output) */
        int    highdn; /* output high-end stretch limit     (output) */
        double lper;   /* low-end percent saturation        (input) */
        double hper;   /* high-end percent saturation       (input) */
        int    nlev;   /* dimension of his                  (input) */
   
        NOTE: lper and hper are casted to floats within the C-bridge.

2 Operation

  The histogram of a picture is a grey level frequency table such that:

      H(i) = number of occurences of pixels with DN value i,
             for i=1,1,2,...,NLEV

  Define an area function A(i,j), representing the area under the histogram
  between indices i and j.  That is, A(i,j) is the sum of all H(k),
  for k=i,i+1,i+2,...,j.

  Then A(1,NLEV) represents the total area under the histogram (i.e. the total
  number of pixels in the image).  ASTRCH determines two indices ILOW and 
  IHIGH such that:

      a) ILOW is the largest i which satisfies the equation
 	        A(1,i) < LPER*A(1,NLEV)
      b) IHIGH is the smallest i which satisfies the equation
	        A(i,NLEV) < HPER*A(1,NLEV)

  Since the indices start at 1 and DNs start at 0, the output variables
  LOWDN and HIGHDN are calculated as LOWDN=ILOW-1 and HIGHDN=IHIGH-1.
