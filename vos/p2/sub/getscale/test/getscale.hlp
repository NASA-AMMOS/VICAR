1 GETSCALE

  GETSCALE chooses a convenient scale for compressing a 64K grey-level
  histogram into 256 grey levels.  The output scale may be in units of
  DN, IOF, or radiance.

  Calling Sequence:

	CALL GETSCALE(ITYPE,LABEL,MAXDN,ISCALE,OSCALE,IND)
  where
	INTEGER*4 ITYPE		!Histogram units (2=DN, 3=IOF, 4=radiance)
	REAL*4 LABEL(80)	!Label array returned by subroutine GETLABCON
	INTEGER*4 MAXDN		!Maximum DN in 64K histogram
	INTEGER*4 ISCALE	!Scale of 64K histogram
	INTEGER*4 OSCALE	!Scale of 256 grey-level histogram
	INTEGER*4 IND		!Return indicator (1=normal, 0=failure)

  The subroutines GETSCALE and HISCALE are used to prepare histograms for
  display.  See program HICCUP for an example of their use.

2 Operation

  The histogram scale may be in units of DN (ITYPE=2), IOF (ITYPE=3), or
  radiance (ITYPE=4).  In each of these three scales, the histogram is
  compressed by setting all negative DN values to 0 DN and scaling the
  positive DNs as follows:

  If ITYPE=2, the input DNs are divided by some power of 2, chosen so that the
  maximum input DN value is scaled to a value that is greater than 128 but
  less than 256.

  If the keyword 'IOF is specified, the histogram is scaled to units of
  IOF times some scale factor, chosen so that:
    (a) the maximum input DN value is scaled to a value that is greater
        than 128 but less than 256.
    (b) 256 on the output scale is some convenient IOF unit (one of the
        digits 1,2,4, or 5 multiplied by a power of 10).

  If the keyword 'RADIANCE is specified, the histogram is scaled to units
  of nanowatts/cm**2/steradian/nanometer times some convenient scale
  chosen as in 'IOF above.

  LABEL is the array returned from a call to GETLABCON to retrieve the
  label information for the image whose histogram is to be compressed.
  The radiometric scale of the input image is retrieved from this array.
