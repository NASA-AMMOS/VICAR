Let's test MASSAGE_STRING first (know your ascii) ...
First print the 7 input characters of the string to massage:
 
 1st char: 61; 2nd char: 62; 3rd char: 63; 4th char: 64
 5th char: 65; 6th char: 20; 7th char: 20;
 
Then the 8 output characters - trailing spaces removed, null
terminated, and changed to upper case.
 
 1st char: 41; 2nd char: 42; 3rd char: 43; 4th char: 44
 5th char: 45; 6th char: 0; 7th char: 0; 8th char: 0
 
Wasn't that fun. Now testing SUMMARIZE_SPK:
