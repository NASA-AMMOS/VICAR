1 TRITRA

    To convert a line, sample pair using GEOMA parameters.
    
2  CALLING SEQUENCE

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL TRITRA(IND,CONV,NPH,NPV,LINE,SAMP,MODE)
  C Calling Sequence:        ztritra(&ind,conv,nph,npv,&line,&samp,mode);


2  ARGUMENTS

      IND         0 = normal return, 1 = abnormal condition sensed.
                  If IND is equal to 1 an explanatory message will be
                  produced.      
      CONV array  The GEOMA parameters, beginning with the first word
                  following the parameter keywords (word #9 if GEOMAV
                  was used to create them).  The declaration is
                  REAL CONV(4,NPH,NPV) or for ztritra
                  float *conv;

      NPH         The number of horizontal vertices/row       I*4
                  (nph, npv, and mode are passed by value
                  for ztritra.)

      NPV         The number of vertical vertices/column      I*4

      LINE        Line number (replaced on return)            R*4 (or float *)

      SAMP        Sample number (replaced on return)          R*4 (or float *)

      MODE        0 = New line, new sample to old line, old sample.
                  1 = Old line, old sample to new line, new sample.

      Note:       Either quadrilaterals or triangles (degenerate quadri-
                  laterals) can be processed.

2  OPERATION

     This routine will convert a line, sample pair using GEOMA parameters.
     The coordinates can be converted in either direction.
