1 LIGHTING

Calculate the phase, incidence, and emission angles for a specific latitude,
longitude.

FORTRAN calling sequence:

      CALL LIGHTING(SBUF,LAT,LON,phase,incidence,emission)

where:

      REAL*8 SBUF(200)  !Buffer returned by subroutine GETSPICE95
      REAL*8 LAT        !Planetocentric latitude of surface pt (deg)
      REAL*8 LON        !West-longitude of surface pt (deg)
      REAL*8 PHASE,INCIDENCE,EMISSION	!Output lighting angels (deg)

C calling sequence:

      zlighting(sbuf,lat,lon,phase,incidence,emission);

where:

      double sbuf[100];  /* Buffer returned by subroutine GETSPICE95 */
      double lat;        /* Planetocentric latitude of surface pt (deg) */
      double lon;        /* West-longitude of surface pt (deg) */
      double *phase,*incidence,*emission;  Output lighting angels (deg) */

2 Operation

Lighting uses an oblate spheroid model of the target body.  The equatorial
and polar radii are extracted from SBUF.

The latitude-longitude of the subsolar and subspacecraft points, and the
distances from the target center to the sun and spacecraft are extracted from
SBUF.  These values are sufficient to compute the following at the surface
point defined by (LAT,LON):

   S = unit vector from surface point to Sun
   C = unit vector from surface point to spacecraft
   N = unit vector normal to surface

Then:

   PHASE = ARCCOS(S o C)
   INCIDENCE = ARCCOS(N o S)
   EMISSION = ARCCOS(N o C)

where o is the dot product.  All computations are performed in double precision.
