   Compute picture scale, north angle, azimuth angles, and slant range for
   a selected point in an image of the ring plane.

  C Calling Sequence:

        #include "mp_routines.h"
        zrpicscale(sbuf,data,mp,mptype,sclat,sclon,r,nl,ns,pbuf,&line,&sample);
  where:
        double *SBUF;           Buffer returned by subroutine GETSPICE
        float  *data;           Image geometry data (see below)
       	MP     *mp              Address of Structure created by mpInit(MP)

      	double  sclon;          Subspacecraft planetocentric west-longitude in degrees
        double  r;              Ring radius at which computation is performed
       	int     nl;             Number of lines in image
        int     ns;             Number of samples in image
        float  *pbuf;           Output array of computed terms (see below)
        double *line,*samp;     (Output) Coordinates were computation is done

  The image geometry DATA is only used if the MP array is not valid.  This
  would occur if the input image label did not contain MP or PERSLAB labels.
  The contents of DATA should be as follows:

       DATA(1-18)  = OM matrix              
       DATA(19-24) = RS vector
       DATA(25) = polar radius (km)            
       DATA(26) = equatorial radius (km) 
       DATA(27) = focal length (mm)
       DATA(28) = optical axis line        
       DATA(29) = optical axis sample      
       DATA(30) = scale in pixels/mm.      
       DATA(31)-DATA(37) = ignored
       DATA(38) = range to target body (km)
       DATA(39)-DATA(40) = ignored

  The contents of the output buffer are:
    PBUF(1) = radial picture scale in meters/pixel
    PBUF(2) = longitudinal picture scale in meters/pixel
    PBUF(3) = north angle
    PBUF(4) = sun azimuth
    PBUF(5) = spacecraft azimuth
    PBUF(6) = slant range
    PBUF(7) = north azimuth
    PBUF(8) = latitude of surface point where computations are performed
    PBUF(9) = longitude of surface point where computations are performed

  If an argument cannot be computed, its value is returned as -999.

  NOTE: if MPTYPE is not 7 or 8, or if the projection type is not POINT
  PERSPECTIVE, then the azimuth angles and slant range cannot be calculated
  and therefore are not returned ( PBUF(3) - PBUF(6)).

  NOTE: RPICSCALE currently is not implemented for map projected images.

  MPTYPE = 7 for image space (DATA buffer is used)
         = 8 for object space (DATA buffer is used)
         = other (MP buffer is used)

2 Operation

  If the image has not been projected, it is assumed to be in object-space.

  The picture scale, north azimuth, sun azimuth, and spacecraft azimuth
  are computed and returned along with the line-sample location at which
  the computations are performed.

  All computations are performed at the point on the visible ring at the given
  radius closest to the camera.

  For a detailed description of the algorithms used see the documentation for
  subroutines RAZIMUTH and RING_SCALE.


2 History

  Original Programmer: Gary Yagi, November 1, 1997
  Current Cognizant Programmer: Gary Yagi
  Source Language: C
  Revision history: New

  25 Jun 1998 TXH   Modified rpicscale's call to zring_scale to have its
                    float parameters to be passed-by-reference.   The problem
                    was found under SGI, where its float values are treated
                    as doubles.
