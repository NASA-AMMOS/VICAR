2 OPERATION

GETGEOM returns GEOMA parameters which can be used by routine CONVISOS to
correct for the geometric distortions induced by vidicon camera systems.  All
missions flown by JPL since Mariner 9 (Mariner Venus Mercury) are supported.
The parameters are returned in PARBUF.

For CCD camera systems (Galileo SSI), an optical distortion model is used and
the buffer PARBUF does not apply.  However, the string 'GLL  ' is stored in
the first two words of PARBUF, and CAMERA is stored in the third word of
PARBUF.  This is a cludge to provide CONVEV/CONVISOS with these arguments.

If MODE=0, nominal GEOMA parameters are returned.  The nominal geometric
distortion parameters for a given camera are based on nominal locations for 
the reseaux.

If MODE=1, then the GEOMA parameters are read from the GEOMA parameter file
pointed to be UNIT.  The GEOMA parameter file must be an IBIS tiepoint file in
the format output by programs RESLOC and FARENC.  Note that GETGEOM will both
open and close the file.
