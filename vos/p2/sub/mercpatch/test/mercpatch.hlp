2 Operation
  Map2 labels require that the latitude and longitude values are for
line=1, sample=1. Sometimes programs obtain latitudes and longitudes
for other lines/samples. Passing these values to MERCPATCH via the DATA
buffer changes these values to line 1, sample 1 and the corresponding
latitudes and longitudes.
