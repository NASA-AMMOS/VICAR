1 MULV

PURPOSE: Multiplies the elements of two arrays

 Fortran calling sequence:  CALL MULV(DCODE, N, A, B, INCA, INCB)
 C Calling Sequence:        zmulv(dcode, n, a, b, inca, incb);
 
  INCA and INCB are REQUIRED arguments. (dcode, n, inca, and incb are
  passed by value for zmulv.)

  Arguments:

    DCODE  (input, integer)           data format code
    N      (input, integer)           number of elements
    A      (input, DCODE data type)   first input array
    B      (in/out, DCODE data type)  second input,output array
             On output B(i) = B(i)*A(i)   [i=1,..,N] for case of INCA=1=INCB.
    INCA   (input, integer)           A array index increment
    INCB   (input, integer)           B array index increment

 REVISION HISTORY:                                          
   3-30-93  ..SP....  Made portable for UNIX - Adapted from addv.
                      Added zmulv for calls from C.  Changed name from
                      mul to mulv (added v for most of the vector routines).
                      ELIMINATED OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR PORTABILITY.

DESCRIPTION

  This routine divides the elements of two given arrays A and B.  On output  
  B(j) = B(j)*A(i). The two arrays may be any of the data types listed in the
  table for DCODE, which controls the assumed combination of data types.


  The calling sequence:

       CALL MULV(DCODE, N, A, B, INCA, INCB)

  Is equivalent to the following code:


       I = 1
       J = 1
       DO K=1,N
          B(J) = B(J)*A(I)
          I    = I + INCA
          J    = J + INCB
       ENDDO

  Where all arguments are INTEGER*4 except for the arrays whose
  data types are controlled by the data code DCODE.
