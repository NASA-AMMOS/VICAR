VICAR subroutine BATCH

Purpose:

       Batch is a subroutine that returns an integer values indicating
   whether a TAE job is running interactively, asynchronously or in batch.


Operation:

       Batch uses zvp to obtain the value of the global variable
   $RUNTYPE and returns an integer depending on its value. Batch
   expects the $RUNTYPE global to be capitalized

  Returned values:   0  if  $RUNTYPE == INTERACTIVE
                     1  if  $RUNTYPE == BATCH
                     2  if  $RUNTYPE == ASYNC
                    99  if  $RUNTYPE has some undefined value

Calling sequence:

  Fortran:    call batch(i)

  C:          i = batch();
