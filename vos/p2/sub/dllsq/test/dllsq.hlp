1 DLLSQ


  Fortran Calling Sequence:     DLLSQ  (A,B,M,N,L,X,IPIV,EPS,IER,AUX)

  C Calling Sequence:     IER = zdllsq (A,B,M,N,L,X,IPIV,EPS,AUX)

  Arguments: 
		A (input)	double precision M by N coefficient matrix.
                                A is modified by DLLSQ.
		B (input)	double precision M by L right hand side matrix.
                                B is modified by DLLSQ.
		M (input)	row number of matrices A and B
		N (input)	column number of matrix A, row # of matrix X.
                                N must not be greater than M.
		L (input)	column number of matrices B and X
		X (output)	double precision N by L solution matrix
		IPIV (output)	integer output vector of dimension N which
				contains pivitol information.
		EPS (input)	double precision parameter which specifies a
				relative tolerance for determination of rank of
				matrix A.  Generally you can set EPS = 1.D-15.
                                (When dealing with ill conditioned matrices it
                                is best to set EPS to the precision of the
                                computer (1.D-15 for VAX) times the largest
                                element in the matrix.)
		IER (output)	a resulting error parameter.  IER=0 for success.
                                IER must be passed by reference when calling 
                                the C bridge function 'zdllsq'.
		AUX (input)	a dummy double precision auxiliary storage
				array dimension max(2*N,L).
