1 GPDSLABEL routine ZAPDSLINE

ZAPDSLINE( FPTR, TYPE, LABELITEM, VALUE, NUMBER_OF_VALUES )

Purpose: To add a PDS style label line to an open non-VICAR file by accepting
	 a FILE* to the output file and all the necessary inputs to create
	 the label line.

2 Parameters passed:

	FPTR
	a FILE * that may be created with fopen(...) statement;


	TYPE
	a character to specify the manner in which the PDS item label value
	(VALUE) is to be treated.  TYPE may be any one of the following 
	characters:

		'C','c'		- indicates that the string (LABELITEM) will be
				  treated as the entire PDS label line and
				  VALUE will not be used.
		'I','i' 	- integer label value
		'L','l'		- literal string to be enclosed in single
				  quotes (e.g. 'GLL-E-NIMS') on the PDS 
				  label line
		'R','r','F','f' - real or floating point label value
		'S','s'		- character string to be enclosed in double
				  quotes on the PDS label line
		'W','w'		- PDS recognized string to be free of 
				  delimiters on the PDS label line;

	LABELITEM
	a character string which includes the PDS label item name, the label 
	item name's spacing from the previous carriage return and line feed, 
	and the equal sign (=).  EX. LABELITEM = "   IMAGE_ID = "

	VALUE
	the argument of LABELITEM, a pointer to the value to be passed to be 
	placed on the right side of the equal sign.  This may be a pointer to 
	a character string, a real or floating point value or an integer.

	NUMBER_OF_VALUES
	the number of times VALUE is to be printed after LABELITEM.
	If TYPE is 'C', NUMBER_OF_VALUES should be set to one (1).
