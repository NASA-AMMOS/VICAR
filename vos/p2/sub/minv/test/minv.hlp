1 MINV


  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CALL MINV(A,N,D,L,M)
  C Calling Sequence:        zminv(a,n,d,l,m); /* n is passed by value */

  Arguments: 
		A (input)	REAL N by N input matrix.
		N (input)	order of matrix A
		D (output)	resultant determinant
		L (input)	Work vector of length N
		M (input)	Work vector of length N

2 History

  Original Programmer: Steve Pohorsky
  Current Cognizant Programmer: Steve Pohorsky
  Made portable for UNIX  RNR(CRI)   02-MAY-94 
  Removed LIB_LOCAL from imake file as per FR85780  (CRI)  07-MAR-95

  Source Language: Fortran

2 Operation

  This subroutine uses MATH77 routines (from LINPACK) SGEFA, SGED, and SGEI
  to invert the matrix and calculate the determinant.  The 'C' bridge will
  interchange row and column before and after the minv call.  This is done
  because a FORTRAN matrix is column-major and 'C' is row-major order.
	
2 Arguments

	A (input/Output) REAL N by N input matrix. On return, matrix contains
			 the resulting inverse.
	N (input)	 order of matrix A
	D (output)	 resultant determinant. D=0 if A is singular.
	L (input)	 Work vector of length N
	M (input)	 Work vector of length N

     A, D, L, M are REAL*4    N is INTEGER*4

     N is passed by value for zminv.
