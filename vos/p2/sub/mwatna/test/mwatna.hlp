1 MWATNA

  Given a (line,sample) coordinate in a Voyager wide-angle image,
  transforms these coordinates to the corresponding (line,sample)
  coordinates in the narrow-angle camera field of view.  Both
  input and output coordinates are assumed to be in object space
  (i.e. IPL defined geometrically corrected coordinate space).

  Note: Due to the nature of this subroutine's call interface, the
        last parameter, it is not recommended for use with the C
        language.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence: 
                CALL MWATNA(ICAM,WALINE,WASAMP,NALINE,NASAMP,&nnn)

  Arguments: 

      INTEGER*4 ICAM         Input Voyager camera serial number
      REAL*4 WALINE,WASAMP   Input wide-angle (line,sample)
      REAL*4 NALINE,NASAMP   Output narrow-angle (line,sample)

      &nnn is a statement label to which MWATNA will return if ICAM
  is an invalid Voyager camera serial number.  Valid serial numbers
  are:
		4 = VGR-2 WA
		5 = VGR-2 NA
		6 = VGR-1 WA
		7 = VGR-1 NA
      ICAM (icam) may either specify the wide-angle or narrow-angle camera
  (i.e. ICAM (icam) =4 or 5 will produce the same effect).

3 Operation

  The wide-angle (line,sample) coordinate is converted into a vector
  (x,y,z) from the camera objective to the point in the focal plane
  corresponding to the pixel location.  The vector is then transformed
  into the narrow-angle camera field of view by multiplying the
  vector by a rotation matrix provided by Mert Davies (see Nov 1979
  Rand report), and subsequently converted into narrow-angle
  (line,sample) coordinates.
