1  pmjs

2  PURPOSE

      Subroutine to print the location of the reseau for a Voyager frame.


  FORTRAN calling Sequence:  CALL pmjs(rloc,n)
  C Calling Sequence:        zpmjs(rloc,n)
			



2  ARGUMENTS

     rloc    is a floating point array of 404 elements, containing
             the line-sample coordinates of each reseau mark in the
             following order:

                            l(1),s(1),l(2),s(2),....l(202),s(202)

     n       is an integer which specifies the precision of the array
             'rloc'.  'n' is 1 for single precision arrays (REAL*4) and 2
             for double precision arrays (REAL*8).

     NOTE:   Both 'rloc' and 'n' are inputs to the program
