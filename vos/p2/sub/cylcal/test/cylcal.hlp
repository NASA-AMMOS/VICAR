2 PURPOSE

  CYLCAL calculates the line, sample position on a Lambert
  cylindrical equal area projection for a specified latitude
  and longitude on a planet.  Given a line, sample position 
  on a cylindrical map, the program calculates the latitude
  and longitude.  This routine is designed to be used by the
  general mapping subroutine CONVEV, and in most cases it is 
  appropriate for the user to call CONVEV rather than directly 
  calling CYLCAL.  Note that for an oblate spheroid this
  projection is not strictly equal area, because there is not
  an intermediate projection onto the authalic sphere.

2 ARGUMENTS
    
3 ITYPE
        Flag indicating which type of transformation is being processed:
          1 - line & sample to latidute & longitude
          2 - latitude & longitude to line & sample

3 RLAT
	The real variable which at entrance contains either the
	line or latitude of a point, depending upon ITYPE, and 
	on exit contains the converse.
3 RLON
 	The real variable which at entrance contains either the 
	sample or longitude of a point, depending upon ITYPE, and
	on exit contains the converse.
3 ZC
  	A real variable which contains the line position of the 
	equator in the cylindrical projection.
3 CPSI
        A real variable which contains the longitude of sample
	one in the cylindrical projection.
3 F
        A real variable which contains the projection scale at
	the equator (Km/pixel).
3 FL
        A real variable which contains the polar radius of a planet
3 REQ
        A real variable which contains the equatorial radius of 
	the planet.
3 PI
        A single precision value of PI (3.14159265)
3 FLAG
        A real variable which contains the off-planet flag value
	for an ITYPE=1 transformation.  If a line, sample position
	specified is off the planet then RLONG and RLAT are set 
	to this flag value.


2 OPERATION

          Given a line, sample position on a cylindrical map,
          the program calculates the latitude and longitude.
          This routine is designed to be used by the general
          mapping subroutine CONVEV, and in most cases it is more
          appropriate for the user to call CONVEV rather than directly
          calling CYLCAL.  Note that for an oblate spheroid this projection
          is not strictly equal area, because there is not an intermediate
          projection onto the authalic sphere.
2 METHOD
          For ITYPE = 1 (line & sample to latitude & longitude) the 
          following  equations are solved.

            LAMDA = ARCSIN (x * k / R'lamda)     (latitude)
            PHI   = CPSI - (y * k / r) * 180/PI  (longitude)

          Where  x = ZC - SAMPLE
                y = LINE - 1
                k = F
                r = REQ
       
          Note: The latitude equation is a recursive relationship. There
               may be formulations which avoid this problem, but the problem
               treats it as follows.
               First an approximate value for LAMDA is calculated using
               R'lamda = r.  This value of LAMDA is then used to calculate
               a better value for the radius using the equation:

               R'lamda = A / ((A*A)/(B*B) + (1 - (A*A)/(B*B)) * (W*W))

               Where A = REQ,  B = FL  &  w = cos LAMDA

          This procedure is repeated using the new value of R'lamda, until
          successive values of LAMDA differ by less than single precision
          significance.

          For ITYPE = 2 the following equations are solved.

             x = ZC - (R'lamda / k) sin LAMDA

             y = ((PI * R) / (180 * k)) * (0 - CPSI) + 1
