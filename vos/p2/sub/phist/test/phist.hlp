1  PHIST

PURPOSE: Prints out a histogram in a format similar to the VICAR program
         LIST. The number of histogram levels to be printed, and the number 
         of spikes within the histogram may be specified. Zero frequency
         levels may be printed where needed.

USAGE:   CALL PHIST(HIS, NFREQ, LOW, HIGH, NSPIKE, MODE)

PARAMETERS:

      HIS    = Fullword integer histogram array.

      NFREQ  = Fullword integer, total number of sample frequencies

      LOW    = Fullword integer, is the optional lower value of the DN range
               included within the histogram (Default: LOW = 0).

      HIGH   = Fullword integer, is the optional upper value of the DN range
               included within the histogram (Default: HIGH = 225).

      NSPIKE = Fullword integer, is the optional number of spikes within the 
               histogram. The LOW and HIGH DN values are excluded when 
               searching for spikes (Default: NSPIKE = 0).

      MODE   = MODE = 1 if zero frequecy levels are to be listed, 
               MODE = 0 otherwise (Default MODE = 0). Optional arguement.


      NOTE: ALL OPTIONALS REQUIREMENTS ARE NOW REQUIRED ARGUMENTS.

  EXAMPLE

  In this example, a histogram containing 512 grey levels will be 
  printed out.

         INTEGER HIS(512)
                  .
                  .
                  .
         NFREQ = 0
         DO I = 1,512
            NFREQ = NFREQ + HIS(I)
         ENDDO
         LOW = 0
         HIGH = 511
         NSPIKE = 5
         MODE = 0
    
         CALL PHIST(HIS, NFREQ, LOW, HIGH, NSPIKE, MODE) 

HISTORY

Original Programmer: H. J. Frieden, 2 June 1974
Current Cognizant Programmer: Lucas W. Kamp, 1 May 1983
Source Language: Fortran
Revision:
  11 Jul 97  T. Huang  ...Changed GRAY index from a 4-character display
                          to a 5-character display for Cassini support.
                          Cassini has data range (-4095..4095).
                       ...Modified tphist.imake to use ANSI C.  This allows
                          tzphist.c to be compiled under HP.
  24 Oct 96  S. Chang  ...Fixed histogram legend display.  (FR89363)
   1 SEP 93  D. Knight ...Ported to Unix
  14 Jan 89  G. Yagi   ...Reduce spikes of it results in 0 max frequency.
  21 JUN 84  C. Avis   ...ADDED '.'S TO PRNT CALLS
  18 MAY 83  L. Kamp   ...CONVERTED TO VAX.
  04 MAR 75  G. Yagi   ...Added four optional arguements, calls to ARGQ and MVE.
