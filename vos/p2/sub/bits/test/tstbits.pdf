tzbits help
! Test with half word=aaaa, full word=aaaaaaaa  The point of this call
! is to get the C and Fortran versions to look at the same words.  Fortran
! is hardwired to these values because the old Fortran tester was, and
! the requirements say we don't have to upgrade the test programs.
! However, I didn't think these tests were that great, so I made the
! C tester more powerful and more flexible.
tzbits aaaa aaaaaaaa
! Now use it with the C hardwired parameters - I think it tests
! the bits a little better by giving a different value to each
! byte.
tzbits
! Extract the bottom half of the full word
tzbits lobit=0 hibit=15
! Extract an arbitrary portion of the full word
tzbits lobit=3 hibit=23
