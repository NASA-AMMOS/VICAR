1 BITS

PURPOSE:   Extracts a bit string from IN and places it, right justified,
           into fullword OUT.

USAGE:
FORTRAN:   CALL BITS(IN, LOBIT, HIBIT, OUT)
           CALL HBITS(IN, LOBIT, HIBIT, OUT)

C:         void zbits(in,lowb,highb,out)
             long int in;
             int lowb,highb;
             long int *out;
           void zhbits(in,lowb,highb,out)
             short int in;
             int lowb,highb;                         /* uses 0 to N-1 */
             long int *out;

PARAMETERS:

     IN    =  Is a halfword(zhbits,HBITS) or fullword(zbits,BITS) integer
              variable containing the bits to be moved into OUT.

     LOBIT =  Is the (integer) start bit of the string to be extracted.
 
     HIBIT =  Is the (integer) end   bit of the string to be extracted.

     OUT   =  Is the (fullword) integer variable containing the right
              justified, extracted bits.

    Note that in numbering bits, the least significant(low order) bit
is bit 0.

DESCRIPTION

These routines provides the C or Fortran programmer with a function
to extract an arbitrary bit string from a halfword or fullword variable.
This facilitates further manipulation such as printing, testing, comparing
etc.
