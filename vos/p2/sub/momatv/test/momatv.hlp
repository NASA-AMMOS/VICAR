      SSSP              R*8   SAMPLE COORD.   OF SUBSPACECRAFT POINT

      FOC               R*8   CAMERA FOCAL LENGTH, MM                
       BL               R*8   WEST LONGITUDE OF SSP--DEGREES         
      PHI               R*8   LATITUDE OF SSP--DEGREES               
      THT (SEE SPECIAL  R*8   ANGLE OF PLANETARY SPIN AXIS (NORTH),  
           CASE LIST)         MEASURED IN PICTURE PLANE AT SSP,      
                              CLOCKWISE FROM UP--DEGREES             
      VABS              R*8   DISTANCE TO PLANET FROM S/C--KM

      MATRIX(3,3)       R*8   ROTATION MATRIX FROM PLANET TO CAMERA  
      VECTOR(3)         R*8   TRANSLATION VECTOR, IN PLANET SYSTEM
                                                                     

2 OPERATION:

    THIS ROUTINE COMPUTES THE PLANET TO CAMERA ROTATION MATRIX AND   
    THE VECTOR FROM PLANET CENTER TO SPACECRAFT, EXPRESSED IN THE 
    PLANET SYSTEM.  A VECTOR IN THE CAMERA SYSTEM, VPR, IS THEN   
    GIVEN IN TERMS OF THE SAME VECTOR IN THE PLANET SYSTEM, V, BY 
    VPR = (MATRIX)*(V-VECTOR).                       
   

    THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL CASES CAN BE HANDLED BY THE PROGRAM IF THE 
    INPUT VARIABLES ARE PROPERLY SET                                 
                  CASE 1 THE SSP IS A POLE, NOT IN THE PICTURE CENTER
             PROCEDURE   BL IS MEANINGLESS AND NOT LOOKED AT.  THT AS
                         DEFINED ABOVE IS ALSO MEANINGLESS.  IT WILL 
                         BE ASSUMED TO CONTAIN A POSITIVE NUMBER     
                         WHICH EQUALS THE WEST LOMGITUDE OF THE      
                         PICTURE CENTER.                             
                                                                     
                  CASE 2 THE SSP IS BOTH A POLE AND THE PICTURE      
                         CENTER                                      
             PROCEDURE   THE ROTATION IS TRIVIAL, BUT BL & THT ARE   
                         AGAIN MEANINGLESS, SO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
                         IS REQUIRED.  SET THT (NORANG) TO A POSITIVE
                         NUMBER EQUALLING THE W LONGITUDE OF THE UP- 
                         GOING MERIDIAN IN THE INPUT PICTURE.        
                                                                     
                                                                     
    NOTE--CASES SUCH AS THE SSP BEING IN PICTURE CENTER BUT NOT A    
          POLE, OR POLE BEING IN PICTURE CENTER BUT NOT THE SSP, DO   
          NOT NEED SPECIAL HANDLING.                                 
    NOTE--IN ALL CASES, VARIABLES OTHER THAN THT AND BL MUST BE      
          PROPERLY SET.
