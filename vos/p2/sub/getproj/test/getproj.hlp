1 GETPROJ

  Description:

	VICAR subroutine GETPROJ returns Project ID, Camera serial number and 
          FDS from the VICAR label of the input file unit.

  FORTRAN calling sequence:
	INTEGER      unit,camera,fds,ind
	CHARACTER*5  project

        CALL getproj(unit,project,camera,fds,ind)

  C calling sequence:
	int  unit,camera,fds,ind;
	char project[6];

        zgetproj(unit,project,&camera,&fds,&ind);

2 ARGUMENTS

  Input:
	unit	- unit number of an OPENED file containing picture
	
  Output:
	project - spacecraft identity
                  valid are:
                    GLL, VGR-1, VGR-2, VIKOR, MAR10, MAR-9, 
                    and WFPC1 for space telescope (old optics),
                    and WFPC2 for space telescope (first optics upgrade)
                    and CASSI           (Cassini)
                    and MPF             (Mars Pathfinder)
		    and M98		(Mars 98 Lander)
		    and M01		(Mars 01 Testbed)
	camera  - camera serial number
                    For WFPC 1=PC and 2=WF cameras
                    For CASSI 1=ISSNA 2=ISSWA 21=ISSNA SUM2 22=ISSWA SUM2
                              41=ISSNA SUM4 42=ISSWA SUM4
                    For MPF, M98, M01: 0 always
	fds     - image number
	            for VGR is the fds count
	            for GLL is the sclk count
        	    for WFPC, 0=fds not applicable
                    for CASSI is the sclk count
                    for MPF, M98, M01: 0 always
	ind	- 0=normal   1=error

  Mars Pathfinder/M98/M01 support is partial (mission name only).  If the other
  parameters are needed, they can be added - but access to them is much
  better via the MPF/M98/M01 label routines (which are in the MARS library
  and thus inaccessible to generic p2 programs).
