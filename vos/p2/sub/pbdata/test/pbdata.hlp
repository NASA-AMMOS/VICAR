1  PBDATA

  PBDATA will return the planet radii, axial rotation rate, and 
  solar range of a specified planetary body.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

   Fortran calling sequence:

       CALL PBDATA(NAME,buf,*nnn)

       CHARACTER*12 NAME	!Input target-body name
       REAL*4 BUF(20)		!Output physical constants.
       *nnn			!Statement label of an alternate return address

    NAME must be left justified and padded on the right with blanks.
    The alternate return is taken if an the input NAME is invalid.

   C calling sequence:

       status = zpbdata(name,buf);

       char name[12];		!Input target-body name
       float buf([20];		!Output physical constants.
       int status;		!0 = failure, 1 = success

2  OPERATION

   The physical constants are retrieved from SPICE, except for
   solar range, which is hard-coded within the source file.
   
   PBDATA will fill BUF with the following data:

        Word       Physical constant (MAP2 symbol and unit)
        1          equatorial radius at long. LORA (RA, km)
        2          equatorial radius at long. LORA+90 (RB, km)
        3          polar radius  (RC, km)
        4          long. of long axis  RA  (LORA, deg)
        5          axial rotation period  (days)
        6          solar range (km)
        7-20       unused

   (Note:  LORA is set to zero, as this was the case in the old code that used
   hard-coded values for all parameters, and it is deprecated by NAIF SPICE.)
