1 HSTGNB

   This subroutine generates a histogram on a picture.

2  OPERATION

        Each call to the routine processes one picture line.  

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

    FORTRAN:  CALL HSTGNB (NSAMP, PIXLIN, HIST) byte data
    C:        STATUS = HSTGNB (NSAMP, PIXLIN, HIST) byte data

2  ARGUMENTS
 

    NSAMP    Number of samples in a picture line

    PIXLIN   Array containing one picture line
              (2 bytes/sample for HSTGEN)
              (1 byte /sample for HSTGNB)

    HIST     Array containing running accumulation for histogram
              (full word integer)
              256 words - HSTGNB
              512 words - HSTGEN

              note:  The HIST array should be set to zeros before the
                     first call is issued.
