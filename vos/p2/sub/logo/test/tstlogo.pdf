! THIS IS A TEST OF SUBROUTINE LOGO.
! LOGO GENERATES LOGO DISPLAYS FOR USE WITH MASK PROGAMS.
! ONE LINE IS GENERATED EACH TIME THE ROUTINE IS CALLED. 
! EACH LOGO OCCUPIES A 64 LINE BY 64 SAMPLE AREA.  
! THE LOGOS ARE STORED HERE SUCH THAT EACH BYTE IS REPRESENTED 
! BY A SINGLE BIT.
! CALL LOGO(IDN,LINE,ILOGO,BGR,BUF)
! WHERE
! IDN IS THE DN VALUE OF THE DISPLAYED LOGO (I.E. 0-255).
! LINE IS THE RELATIVE LINE NUMBER (I.E. 1-64)
! ILOGOS: SPECIFIES THE DESIRED LOGOS:.
!        1=JPL
!        2=MICKEY MOUSE
!        3=GODDARD
!        4=NASA
! BGR IS RESERVED FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE COLOR LOGOS:
!        0=BLACK
!        1=BLUE
!        2=GREEN
!        3=RED
!  BUF IS THE BUFFER IN WHICH THE REQUESTED LOGO LINE IS 
! RETURNED (LOGICAL *1).  IT MUST BE AT LEAST 64 BYTES IN LENGTH.
! TEST THE JPL LOGO WITH IDN=255.
