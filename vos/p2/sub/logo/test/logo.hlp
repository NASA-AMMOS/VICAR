1  LOGO

 PURPOSE: LOGO generates logo displays for use in masking programs.

 Fortran calling sequence:  CALL LOGO(IDN,LINE,ILOGO,BGR,BUF)
 C Calling Sequence:        zlogo(idn,line,ilogo,bgr,buf);
 
  ( idn, line, ilogo, and bgr are passed by value for zlogo.)


 ARGUMENTS:  IDN, LINE, ILOGO, and BGR are input integers.
             BUF is an output buffer of type BYTE.

     IDN     THE DN VALUE FOR THE LOGO

     LINE    THE RELATIVE LINE NUMBER (I.E., 1 - 64)

     ILOGO   SPECIFIES THE LOGO TO BE USED
             1 = JPL
             2 = MICKEY MOUSE
             3 = GODDARD
             4 = NASA (worm logo)

     BGR     RESERVED FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE COLOR LOGOS
             IT SHOULD BE SET AT ZERO AT THE PRESENT TIME
             FUTURE VALUES ARE:
             0 = BLACK AND WHITE
             1 = BLUE
             2 = GREEN
             3 = RED

     BUF     BUFFER IN WHICH LOGO IS RETURNED (BYTE).
             IT MUST BE AT LEAST 64 BYTES IN LENGTH.

2  HISTORY

  Original Programmer: A. Gillespie
  Ported to UNIX:       Steve Pohorsky
  Source Language: C
  Current Cog Progr:    Steve Pohorsky

 REVISION HISTORY:                                          
   6-16-93  ..SP....  Made portable for UNIX.  Converted to C because
                      bit maps should be in hex, which ANSI Fortran
                      does not support.

2  OPERATION

     ALL LOGOS ARE STORED IN LOGO IN PACKED FORMAT, EACH BIT REPRESENTING A 
     BYTE (PIXEL).  FOR EACH CALL TO THE SUBROUTINE, THE SPECIFIED LINE OF THE 
     SPECIFIED LOGO IS UNPACKED FROM 8 BYTES TO THE OUTPUT SIZE OF 64 BYTES.
     ON BITS CAUSE THE CORRESPONDING BYTE IN BUF TO BE SET TO THE VALUE SPEC-
     FIED BY THE DN ARGUMENT WHILE OFF BITS CAUSE NO CHANGE TO THE CORRES-
     PONDING BYTE IN BUF.

2  EXAMPLE

      INTEGER OUNIT
      BYTE  BUF(64)
      CALL XVUNIT(OUNIT,'OUT',1,STAT, ' ')
      CALL XVOPEN(OUNIT,STAT,'OP','WRITE','O_FORMAT','BYTE',
     &            'U_NL',NLO,'U_NS',NSO, ' ')
      DO I=1,64
         CALL ITLA(0,BUF,64)
         CALL LOGO(255,I,1,0,BUF)   ! JPL LOGO AT 255 DN.
         CALL XVWRIT(OUNIT,BUF,STAT,'NSAMPS',64, ' ')
      END DO
      CALL XVCLOSE(OUNIT,STAT, ' ')
