1 LUMLLP

 Subroutine to compute phase, incidence, emission, luminance longitude and
luminance latitude angles for a planet.  LUMLLP is used in photometric
function calculations. 

 FORTRAN Calling sequence:

 CALL LUMLLP(SLAT,SLON,PLAT,PLON,RPOL,REQU,RANGE,RLAT,RLON,TG,CG,CI,
     CE,LUMLAT,LUMLON,MODE,FIRST)

2 ARGUMENTS

 SLAT subsolar latitude                      input    R*4 radians
 SLON subsolar longitude                     input    R*4 radians
 PLAT subspacecraft latitude                 input    R*4 radians
 PLON subspacecraft longitude                input    R*4 radians
 RPOL planet polar radius                    input    R*4 km
 REQU planet equatorial radius               input    R*4 km
 RANGE planet center to spacecraft distance. input    R*4 km
       RANGE=0.0 implies infinite separation.
 RLAT pixel position latitude                input    R*4 radians
 RLON pixel position longitude(west)         input    R*4 radians
 TG   tangent of phase angle (max of 1000.)  returned R*4 --
 CG   cosine of phase angle                  returned R*4 --
 CI   cosine of incidence angle              returned R*4 --
 CE   cosine of emission angle               returned R*4 --
 LUMLAT luminance latitude                   returned R*4 degrees
 LUMLON luminance longitude                  returned R*4 degrees
 MODE 0 specifies a return without computing    input I*4 --
        LUMLAT or LUMLON
 FIRST  an argument to force LUMLLP            input  I*4 
        to do the extensive set up 
        calculations before beginning.
        (See under method.)
2 METHOD
 Warning... an extensive calculation is performed the first time LUMLLP is
called to set certian parameters which depend upon SLAT, SLON, PLAT PLON,
REQU, RPOL.  If the arguments SLAT, SLON,PLAT,PLON,REQU, or RPOL should change,
then the user must set FIRST to 1 to force the extensive recalculation.
If FIRST is not 1, LUMLLP will do the extensive calculations as 
described above on the first call to LUMLLP. Upon subsequent calls to LUMLLP
those extensive setup calculations will be skipped.
If FIRST is set to equal 1, LUMLLP will always do the extensive setup 
calculations. 
 According to Jean Lorre (3-93) the values computed for luminance,
latitude, and longitude are of unknown meaning.  This does not appear to
matter under the current usage of LUMLLP.  Joel Mosher has a version of
LUMLLP where the values for luminance, latitude, and longitude are meaningful.

The values for emission, incidence, and phase have the regular meaning in this
version.
