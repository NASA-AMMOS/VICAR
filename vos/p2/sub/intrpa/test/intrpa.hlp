1 INTRPA

PURPOSE: Fills the elements of an array with values using a
         linear interpolation scheme.

USAGE:  CALL INTRPA(ICODE, NS, BUF, I1, I2)

PARAMETERS:

    ICODE  = Data type code for BUF (See table below).
    NS     = Number of data elements in BUF to fill.
    BUF    = Output array containing interpolated values.
             BUF(1) will contain I1 and BUF(NS) will contain
             I2. Intermediate elements are generated by in-
             terpolation betwen I1 and I2.
    I1     = Lower value of interpolation range.
    I2     = Upper value of interpolation range.

DESCRIPTION

  This FORTRAN routine provides the FORTRAN or C programmer with a
  function to fill-in missing data in an array, by means of linear
  interpolation, for byte, halfword and fullword data types.
