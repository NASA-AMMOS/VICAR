1 CYLPATCH
 Fixes up the CONVEV data buffer (standard MAP buffer) to conform to 
 standards for normal cylindrical projections.

 Calling Sequence:

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  CYLPATCH(RDATA)
  C Calling Sequence:        zcylpatch(rdata);

 Arguments: 
  RDATA is a real*4 40 element array as described in CONVEV.
   rdata(1) - sample 
   rdata(2) - line
   rdata(3) - Latitude 
   rdata(6) - Longitude 
   rdata(7) - scale (km/pixel)
   rdata(39) - projection type = 9
   rdata(25) - polar radius (km)
   rdata(26) - equatorial radius (km)
  Some values will be changed after execution of CYLPATCH.
   rdata(1) - special sample point
   rdata(2) - special line point
   rdata(3) - Latitude at sample 1
   rdata(6) - Longitude (west) at sample 1
  If rdata(39) is not equal to 9 (integer), then data is not for a
  cylindrical projection. CYLPATCH returns without making any changes.

2 Operation
  The user of CONVEV often knows only the line,sample,latitude and 
longitude of a point on a planet. If those values are input to CONVEV,
errors result in the case that the input image is in the Normal 
Cylindrical projection (image type 9). For this type image, CONVEV
expects data(1) to be the sample of longitude 0 and data(6) to be the
longitude of sample 1.  If the CONVEV data buffer is in the form of the
former, CYLPATCH will convert it to the form of the latter. CYLPATCH 
should only be called once on a data buffer, otherwise the buffer 
gets bad values put in it.
  CYLPATCH computes the special line and sample point and special
latitude and longitude points for the normal cylindrical projection.
