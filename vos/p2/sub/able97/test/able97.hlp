ABLE97 - Label extractor for Cassini ISS

PURPOSE:

ABLE97 extracts data from the Cassini ISS flight and ground calibration
labels.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  
                   INTEGER IND,UNIT
                   INCLUDE 'cas_isslab'      !Specifies COMMON block for ABLE97

                   CALL ABLE97(IND,UNIT)

  C Calling Sequence:  #include "cas_isslab.h"
                        able97_typ lab;

                        zable97(&ind,unit,&lab);

where
  IND  = return indicator (output)
  UNIT = VICAR unit number of input file (input)
  lab  = (only for zable97) structure containing extracted label data (output)


Arguments

  IND:  is the return indicator (output integer):
	IND<0 if one or more data items are missing
	IND=0 if all data items are present

  UNIT: specifies the VICAR file unit number of the input file	(input integer).

  lab:  (only for zable97) is a structure containing the items of extracted
	data. The structure of lab is defined in file cas_isslab.h.
        Upon return, the structure is filled as shown in Table 1.
  CAS_ISSLAB:  (only for Fortan calls to ABLE97)  
                ABLE97 uses the COMMON block CAS_ISSLAB as a vehicle for 
                returning data instead of a long argument list or a buffer of 
                various values of various data types.  The elements of this
                common block are shown in Table 2.  (If a Fortran application
                needs to call able97 for more than one image, remember that
                there is only 1 common block named CAS_ISSLAB.  In such a case,
                it is recommended that any elements needed by the application
                be copied immediately after the calls to able97.)

Operation

Before calling ABLE97, the input file (UNIT) must be opened.  Upon return, the
file remains open.

The subroutine extracts label items from the first task of the label.
Ground-calibration labels are identified by the SCETY < 1998.  All other
labels are assumed to be flight.  

Only the ISS instruments are implemented.

If the mission is not CASSINI, the subroutine returns immediately with 
IND=-1.

Most missing label items will cause the subroutine to return immediately with
IND=-1.

HISTORY
  Original Programmer: Charlie Avis 3/1/94
  Current Cognizant Programmer: Charlie Avis
  Source Language: Fortran
  Revisions:
   01 March 94  CCA   ...ABLE97 created as conversion of ABLE86
   05 April 95  CCA   ...modified label adding lossy compression parms and
                         missinglines and radiance
C    1-97  SP   Changed from a VMS Fortran STRUCTURE (previously third argument)
C               to a COMMON block for portability.  
C               Changed INTEGER*2 ... TO INTEGER ala VICAR PORTING GUIDE. 
C               Made portable for UNIX.  Added a separate C bridge (zable97)
C               that uses the original structure ala section 9.4.2 of the
C               Porting Guide.
C    2-99  JRY  Modified to include CASSINI-ISS2 label changes
C    11-99 TLT  Added IMAGETIME
C               Renamed LAB_PREPDUR to LAB_PREPCYCLE
C               Renamed LAB_READOUTDUR to LAB_READOUTCYCLE
C               Renamed READOUT_CYCLE_DURATION to READOUT_CYCLE_INDEX
C               Renamed PREPARE_CYCLE_DURATION to PREPARE_CYCLE_INDEX
C		Added SHUTTER_EVENT_TYPE
c		Changed REXPOS to LAB_EXPOS
C    5-00  AYS  Modified zable97.c sfor2c calls to output to a c string
C    8-00  AYS  Updated to accomodate new vicar property labels
C    10-00 AYS  Added IMAGE_OBSERVATION_TYPE and SEQUENCE_TITLE
C    4-03  VRH  Updated to accomodate tour labels
