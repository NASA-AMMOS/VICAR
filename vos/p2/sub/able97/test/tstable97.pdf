Test Procedure for the subroutine, ABLE97.
.help

   Intended to provide the unit test for the subroutine, ABLE97.
   The test comprises:

       1. Listing the label of a Cassini ISS ground label LABEL-LIST,
       2. And comparing that with the list from the test program.
          TABLE97, which uses ABLE97 to obtain the same information.

   NOTE: Users should understand the Cassini flight and calibration labels
         to correctly analyze the unit test results. The description of
         the labels is documented in a SIS called EGSE VICAR IMAGE DATA FILE,
         C. Avis and S. Kaki.
