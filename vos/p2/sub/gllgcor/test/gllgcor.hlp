VICAR routine GLLGCOR
.help
Purpose:

GLLGCOR converts image line,sample values from raw (image space) coordinates to
geometrically corrected (object space) coordinates or vice-versa.  This routine
is specific to the Galileo SSI camera.

FORTRAN Calling Sequence:

      INTEGER*4 STATUS			!Always 0 (success)
      INTEGER*4 IS_LINE,IS_SAMPLE	!Image space line,sample
      INTEGER*4 OS_LINE,OS_SAMPLE	!Object space line,sample
      INTEGER*4 MODE			!0=OS to IS, 1=IS to OS
      INTEGER*4 ICAM			!1=full frame, 2=summation mode
      CALL GLLGCOR(status,is_line,is_sample,os_line,os_sample,MODE,ICAM)

C Calling Sequence:

      int status;			/* always 0 (success) */
      int is_line,is_sample;		/* Image space line,sample */
      int os_line,os_sample;		/* Object space line,sample */
      int mode;				/* 0=OS to IS, 1=IS to OS */
      int icam;				/* 1=full frame, 2=summation mode */
      status=zgllgcor(&is_line,&is_sample,&os_line,&os_sample,mode,icam);

Operation:

GLLGCOR uses an optical distortion model of the SSI camera where the distortion
is a function of the radial distance from the point where the optical axis
intercepts the focal plane:

	R_is = A*R_os**3 + R_os
where
        R_is is the radial distances from the optical center in Image Space,
        R_os is the radial distances from the optical center in Object Space,
        A (=6.58*10**(-9)) is the optical distortion constant

The optical center is at location line=400, sample=400.  The magnitude of the
distortion is 1.2 pixels at the corners.  All units refer to full-frame images.

The solution of this equation for R_os is from the CRC math tables and is
tailored to this problem (i.e., only one real root is expected and therefore
only one calculated).  The solution is accurate to .0005 pixels for radial
distances varying between 0 and 707 pixels.
