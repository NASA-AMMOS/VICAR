1 ABLE77V2

   ABLE77V2 provides programmers with a convenient means of extracting data
  from VICAR labels conforming to Voyager label format conventions.

  FORTRAN Calling Sequence:  INTEGER*4 IND,UNIT,ARR(50)

                             CALL ABLE77V2(IND,UNIT,ARR)

  C Calling Sequence:   int ind, unit, arr[50];
            
                        zable77v2(&ind,unit,arr)

  Arguments:   
		IND	(output)      integer

		ARR	(output)      integer array

2 Operation

   This subroutine provides programmers with a convenient means of
  extracting data from VICAR labels conforming to Voyager label format
  conventions.

   To utilize ABLE77V2 the calling program must first open the data set in
  question. Once a data set has been properly opened, its labels may be
  scanned by calling ABLE77V2. The subroutine reads each label and extracts
  data items, and fills ARR with the data as shown in TABLE 1. Upon return
  the indicator IND is set, and the data set is left "open".

   If, while performing label processing, ABLE77V2 is unable to successfully
  extract a data item, it fills the corresponding array element with a "not
  found" code of -999 for numeric items, or "!" for alphanumeric items.

2 Arguments

  	IND:    is an output integer, upon return, indicates how processing was
		terminated:
		a)IND<0 indicates that at least one label item is in error.
		b)IND=0 indicates successful completion of processing.

	UNIT:   is an integer specifying the VICAR file unit number
		to be processed.

	ARR:  is an array of at least 1 fullword to receive the extracted
		data. Upon entry, the first word of the array must contain
		an integer value specifying the length of the array in words.
		Upon, return, the array is filled as shown in Table 1.

2 restrictions

  ABLE77V2 checks the first eight bytes of the first non-system label for
  the Voyager identifier. If it is found, the subroutine proceeds with the
  label scan on the assumption that all labels required by that format actually
  appear. Since no checks are made, unpredictable results can be expected if
  this constraint is not met.

2 History

 The function of this subroutine is a subset of that of the JPL routine
 ABLE77, vis.the extraction of certain information from standard VICAR
 labels.  Gary Yagi of JPL once wrote:
  "ABLE77 was written by a graduate student (since departed) who was
  intrigued by obscure languages.  Nobody here understands the program well
  enough to modify it.  I recommend that you re-write the routine from
  scratch."
 This is what I have done.  (Nick Marriage)
