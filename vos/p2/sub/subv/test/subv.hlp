1 SUBV

PURPOSE: Subtracts the elements of two arrays

USAGE:   CALL SUBV(DCODE, N, A, B [,AINC, BINC])

PARAMETERS:

      DCODE= Data types for A and B (See table next page)
      A    = Input array
      B    = Input array. 
             On output B(i) = B(i)-A(i)   [i=1,..,N]
      N    = The number of elements in A and B
      AINC = Sorce vector address increment
      BINC = Destination increment

DESCRIPTION

  This MACRO routine provides the FORTRAN programmer with a function to
  subtract the elements of two given arrays A and B. On output B(i) =
  B(i)-A(i). The two arrays may be any of the data types listed in the
  table for DCODE, which controls the assumed combination of data types.




  The calling sequence:

       CALL SUB(DCODE, N, A, B, AINC, BINC)

  Is equivalent to the following code:


       I = 1
       J = 1
       DO K=1,N
          B(J) = B(J)-A(I)
          I    = I + AINC
          J    = J + BINC
       ENDDO

  Where all arguements are INTEGER*4 except for the arrays whose
  data types are controlled by the data code DCODE
