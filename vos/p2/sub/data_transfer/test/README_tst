There are 2 test programs included for this module:
	tst_data_disk
    &	tst_data_socket

'tst_data_disk' is basically an disk file copy program.  It will copy any disk
file and print how many 128-byte reads it took to copy the file.  This test
verifies the Source and Sink capabilities of the base 'Data' class as well as
the 'Disk' subclasses.

'tst_data_disk' can be though of as the old string and cup telephone.  This
program must be executed two times simultaneously.  In one instance, the
program acts as a server, creating an attachable socket.  The second instance
will be the client and attaches to the server socket.  The server version
is started by passing a positive port number as the only parameter.  This
port number should be larger than 2048 so it does not conflict with system
port numbers.  It is still possible that the specified port number is being
used, so verify that the server version is ready to accept the client before
proceeding.  The client version is started by passing a negative port number,
the same value (but negative) as was specified for the server, and a host
name where the server is running.

Once the 'plumbing' is connected, the client instance will prompt for a
message to send to the server.  After it is entered, the client sends it to the
server, which ackowledges the message, afterwich both instances quit.
