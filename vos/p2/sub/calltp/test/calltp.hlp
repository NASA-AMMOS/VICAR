1 CALLTP

  Module CALLTP contains routines that spawn off the tiepoint collection 
  program TP, given a set of initial points and filename.  These are mostly 
  convenience functions that could be called from batch subroutines for 
  purposes of result verification and corrections.  Currently, one function 
  display_points() is implemented, although more could be added in the 
  future if there is demand.

    display_points displays tiepoints for two images.

  Tiepoints are stored in the temporary directory in the IBIS-2 file and 
  the name of that file is passed to the TP program as an argument.

2  CALLING SEQUENCE
 
  C Calling Sequences:        
 
#include "calltp.h"

    out_array = display_points(file1, file2, array, &n, tp_location);

  FORTRAN Calling Sequences:  not implemented.

2  ARGUMENTS

  display_points

    file1		VICAR image filename
    file2		VICAR image filename
    array		Two-dimensional array of tiepoints in the form
			{ {S11 L11 S12 L12} ... {Sn1 Ln1 Sn2 Ln2} }
    n			Number of tiepoints
    tp_location		Location of TP program.  If NULL is passed, the 
			program will run out of $R2LIB.

2  OPERATION

  display_points: Starts-up interactive tiepoint collection program 
  and gets tiepoints when that program exits.  It returns 2d array 
  in form of { {L11 S11 L12 S12} ... {Ln1 Sn1 Ln2 Sn2} }.  Number of 
  tiepoints n is returned in parameter npoints.
