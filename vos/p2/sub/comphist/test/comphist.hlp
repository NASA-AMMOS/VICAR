1 COMPHIST

  COMPHIST and COMPHIST2 compute the histogram of a byte and halfword image,
  respectively.

  Calling Sequence:

	CALL COMPHIST(IUNIT,SL,SS,NL,NS,HIS,IBUF)
	CALL COMPHIST2(IUNIT,SL,SS,NL,NS,HIS2,IBUF2)

  where
	INTEGER*4 IUNIT		!Logical unit number of image
	INTEGER*4 SL,SS,NL,NS	!Size field of image area used
	INTEGER*4 HIS(256)	!Output 256 grey-level histogram
	INTEGER*4 HIS2(256)	!Output 64K grey-level histogram
	LOGICAL*1 IBUF(NS)	!Buffer for reading byte image
	INTEGER*2 IBUF2(NS)	!Buffer for reading halfword image

  IUNIT,SL,SS,NL,NS are input arguments.  HIS,HIS2,IBUF,IBUF2 are outputs.
  IBUF and IBUF2 must be large enough to hold NS samples of the byte or
  halfword image, respectively.

2 Operation

  The input image must be opened with U_NS defaulted (i.e. no data
  conversion is permitted).  COMPHIST will compute the histogram by
  reading in the specified area of the image.  The histogram of a byte
  image will contain 256 elements, representing the sample frequency
  for DN values 0 to 255.  The histogram of a halfword image will
  contain 64K elements, representing the sample frequency for DN
  values -32768 to 32767.

  See program HICCUP for an example of usage of these subroutines.
