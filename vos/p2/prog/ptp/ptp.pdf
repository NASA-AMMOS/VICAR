VICAR Program PTP:  Perspective-To-Perspective projection
.HELP
PURPOSE

PTP is a VICAR applications program which projects an image of a planet or
satellite so that the resulting image is that of the planet as seen from a
different perspective.  PTP's primary application is to register color triplets
in cases where the time between frames is large enough that noticeable changes
in perspective occur as a result of planet rotation and spacecraft motion.

.page
EXECUTION:

     PTP  INP=PIC  OUT=OPIC  REF=RPIC
where 
   PIC  is the input image to be projected (byte or halfword), and
   OPIC is the output image
   REF  is the reference image,

PIC may be from any mission for which navigation data is available via the
MIPS SPICE server.  If PIC is from Voyager or an earlier mission, it must be a
geometrically corrected image.  If PIC is from Galileo or a later mission, it
must be a raw (uncorrected) image.  OPIC will be output in the same data format
as PIC.

In cases where the reference image is not available, it may be replaced by
supplying the program with enough information to identify it to the SPICE
server:

   PTP  INP=PIC  OUT=OPIC  RSCET=(yr,day,month,hr,min,sec,msec) +
          RCAM=n  TARGET=aaaaaaa
where
   RSCET is the SpaceCraft Event Time of the reference image,
   RCAM is the camera serial number of the reference image, and
   TARGET is the target name.

Note that the input and reference images may be from different missions.  I.e.,
it is possible to project a Cassini image to the same scale and orientation as
a Voyager image (for comparison).

.page
OPERATION

Before running PTP, the input and reference images should be navigated to
correct the camera pointing (see programs NAV, NAV2, FARENC, MANMATCH,
and AUTOMATCH).

PTP reads the VICAR labels of the input and reference images (see INP and REF
parameters) to identify the project, camera ID, target ID, and Spacecraft-Event
Time.  Note that the target is not available in the Voyager label and must be
supplied via the TARGET parameter.

PTP retrieves the navigation data for the input and reference images from the
MIPS SPICE server using SCET, camera, and target to access the appropriate data.
If the reference image is not available, it may be replaced by identifying it
via the RSCET, RCAM, and TARGET parameters.

The camera pointing retrieved from SPICE may be overridden by supplying the
planet center via the PC and RPC parameters.

PTP uses a triaxial ellipsoid model of the planet, defined by three radii
(equatorial long axis, equatorial short axis, and polar).  The values are
obtained via a call to subroutine PBDATA.  This may be overridden by using the
RADII parameter.

The ROT parameter may be used to change the rotation rate or the planet.

.page
GENERATING THE OUTPUT PROJECTION:

PTP projects the image by performing a geometric transformation similar to that
in MAP3.  If the keyword EXACT is specified, the projection is computed exactly
at every pixel.  Otherwise, the projection is calculated on a grid of tiepoints,
and bilinear interpolation is used to compute the projection at intermediate
points.

The initial grid spacing is 32 x 32 pixels.  In areas of the image where this
interpolation generates errors larger than 1/2 pixel (e.g. near the limb), the
grid spacing is reduced in successive steps (16x16, 8x8, 4x4) until a 1/2 pixel
accuracy is achieved.

In general, an output pixel will not project onto an input pixel, but will
project to a point between four input pixels.  The output sample value is
computed via bilinear interpolation over the these four pixels:

        DN = DN1 + (DN2-DN1)*ds + (DN1-DN2-DN3+DN4)*dl

If the 'INCLUDE keyword is specified, all output pixels not on the planet are
generated by offsetting the sky background of the input image by a constant
(the difference between the planet centers).  No perspective geometry is used,
and the planet ring system is treated as though no rotation has occured.
Also, there will be areas of the planet visible from the perspective of the
output image but not visible in the input image (e.g. the area may have rotated
behind the planet).  These areas are generated by using the corresponding
points in front of the planet.  Note that this is a "cludgy" solution.
Beware of odd side effects if the rotation is large.

If INCLUDE is not specified, the sky background is deleted (output
as 0 dn's).

.page
PARAMETERS FOR RETRIEVING CAMERA POINTING FROM SPICE:

The following parameters permit the user to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing from the SPICE kernels (only CKNAME is applicable for Voyager):

SPICEMODE specifies whether SPICE data is retrieved from LOCAL kernels or
or via the REMOTE SPICE server.  If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value
of the environmental variable DEFAULTSPICE.

CKNAME and CKID are alternative ways to specify the C kernel to be used.  For
example, CKNAME=FARE or CKID=M904 specifies that MIPS_FARENC.CK is to be used.
When specified, the CKID parameter overrides the CKNAME parameter.  If the
camera pointing data is not found in the requested C kernel, the other C kernels
are searched.

Within a given C kernel, there may be a number of different versions of camera
pointing for a given image.  The segment identifier for each version contains
provenance information identifying the creator of the pointing data.  One or
more of the following parameters may be used to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing based upon this provenance information:

CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
PROGRAM identifies the program which created the camera pointing.
SPKID identifies the SP-kernel used to create the camera pointing.
USERID identifies the user who created the camera pointing.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

A complete list of CK and SPK IDs are located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

The above parameters are optional, and if defaulted (or if no data is found for
the requested version), the program will attempt to locate the "best" data
available for the given image.  See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode)
for further details.

Examples:  'LOCAL CKNAME=NAIF specifies that SPICE data be retrieved from
          local kernels using camera pointing from predicts or AACS telemetry.

           'REMOTE CKNAME=FARE INSTITUTE=MIPS SPKID=N015 USERID=ADC retrieves
          the camera pointing created by Amy Culver at MIPS using the SP kernel
          GLL_LONG_2.BSP from file MIPS_FARENC.CK via the SPICE server.  (whew!)

It takes longer to search for SPICE data on the basis of provenance
information.  If all provenance parameters are specified, for example, the
program first searches through all the C kernels for an exact match.  If no
match is found, the search is relaxed by removing the CDATE criteria.  If no
match is found, the REQNUM criteria is removed.  Etc.

.page
EXAMPLES

   (1)  PTP INP=1550856.IMG  OUT=OUT.IMG REF=1550854.IMG TARGET=GANYMEDE

        The input image (1550856.IMG) is projected to the same perspective as
        the reference image (1550854.IMG).  The output image is OUT.IMG.
        Since these are Voyager images, the target must be specified.

   (2)  PTP INP=1550856.IMG OUT=OUT.IMG RSCET=(1996,223,14,59,58,123) +
            RCAM=2  TARGET=GANYMEDE

        In lieu of the REF parameter, the reference image is identified by
        time (RSCET) and camera ID.

   (3)  ptp INP=n1354897340.1  OUT=cassini.img  REF=f1634146.img TARGET=JUPITER

	The input is a Cassini image of Jupiter while the reference image is
	a Voyager image taken at approximately the same longitude.  Since the
	reference image is in object space, the output image will be in object
	space, even though the input image is in image space.

Note: These tables are obtained via a call to VICAR subroutine GETCAMCON.  For
active missions, these values may be updated as they are more accurately
determined.

.VARI RMISSION
OPTIONAL KEYWORD
Spacecraft ID of reference image
     e.g.  RMISSION=CASSI
VALID=(VGR-1,VGR-2,GLL,CASSI,VIKOR)
If defaulted, RMISSION is assumed to be the same as the input image.

.VARI RADII
OPTIONAL REAL

PTP uses a triaxial ellipsoid model of the planet, defined by three radii
(equatorial long axis, equatorial short axis, and polar) in km:

    EX:  RADII=(1811.3, 1805.2, 1793.1)

If defaulted, the values are obtained via a call to subroutine PBDATA.

.VARI RP
OPTIONAL REAL
polar radius of oblate spheroid target body (km)

.VARI RE
OPTIONAL REAL
equatorial radius of oblate spheroid target body (km)

.VARI ROT
OPTIONAL REAL
Target body rotation rate (deg/day)
E.g: ROT=870.536

.VARI PC
OPTIONAL REAL
Planet center of input image specified as (line,sample).
 Example: PC=(123.23,432.34)

.VARI RPC
OPTIONAL REAL
Planet center of reference image specified as (line,sample).
 Example: PC=(123.23,432.34)

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.  Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode,
the other mode is attempted.

The processing method is fixed by GETSPICE2 to REMOTE for VGR data as of
6/12/96.  This is only a temporary.

.VARI INCLUDE
If the 'INCLUDE keyword is specified, all output pixels not on the planet are
generated by offsetting the sky background of the input image by a constant
(the difference between the planet centers).  No perspective geometry is used,
and the planet ring system is treated as though no rotation has occured.
Also, there will be areas of the planet visible from the perspective of the
output image but not visible in the input image (e.g. the area may have rotated
behind the planet).  These areas are generated by using the corresponding
points in front of the planet.  Note that this is a "cludgy" solution.
Beware of odd side effects if the rotation is large.

If INCLUDE is not specified, the sky background is deleted (output
as 0 dn's).  This is the default.

.VARI EXACT
By default, the projection is calculated for a grid of tiepoints (the grid 
spacing is 32 x 32 pixels).  All output pixels within the square area 
defined by any four neighboring grid points are projected via interpolation.
In areas of the image where this interpolation generates errors larger than 
1/2 pixel (e.g. the limb), the grid spacing is reduced in successive steps 
(16x16, 8x8, 4x4) until a 1/2 pixel accuracy is achieved.

If the keyword 'EXACT is specified, the projection is computed using the exact
equations at each pixel (rather than via interpolation).

.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  If defaulted, the target
name is extracted from the VICAR label or determined by other TBD means.

A complete list of valid target names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

.VARI CKNAME
CKNAME is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used:

  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  --------      -------------
  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  NAIF		the best NAIF kernel is used

If defaulted, the kernels are searched in the above order.

.VARI CKID
CKID is an alternative way to specify the prefered C-kernel (see CKNAME
parameter):

  CKID	  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  ----	  --------      -------------
  M906	  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  M905	  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  M904	  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  M903	  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  M902	  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  M901	  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  varies  NAIF		there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, CKID overrides the CKNAME parameter.

.VARI USERID
USERID is a three character string which identifies the user who created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  USERID=HBM identifies Helen Mortensen as the creator of the camera
     pointing.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group which created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which created
the camera pointing.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=MIPS specifies that MIPS created the camera pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI PROGRAM
PROGRAM is the first six characters of the program creating the camera pointing.

Ex:  PROGRAM=FARENC specifies that FARENC created the camera pointing.

.VARI SPKID
SPKID specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
SP kernel used to create the camera pointing.  The SP-kernel IDs are located
in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable)
KERNELDB.

Ex:  SPKID=N015 specifies the SP kernel GLL_LONG_2.BSP

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.

Ex:  REQNUM=3456 identifies (somewhat) request number R123456

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.
