.TITLE
VICAR program SUPERRES

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To combine many images into a larger image which can be processed to give
super resolution.

EXECUTION:
register2 inp=listoffiles out=tiepoints
superres inp=(listoffiles,tiepoints) out=superimage
( & optionally ...)
filter2 inp=superimage out=evenbettersuperimage nlw=15 nsw=15 +
 mtf=(1.,0.,5.,.35,5.,.5)

where:
Listoffiles is an ascii list of filenames, one per record.
Tiepoints is an ascii list of tiepoints created by vicar program REGISTER2.

.PAGE
METHOD:
1. Superres reads the image and tiepoints file.
   It creates polynomials from the tiepoints mapping each input to the output. 
2. An output is created SCALE times the inputs in size.
3. For each output pixel..
4. All the nearest input pixels are identified (4 per input image).
5. These pixel centers are mapped to the output sub pixel location.
6. output_dn=sum(dn_in/r_in**2)/sum(1/r_in**2)
     where r_in is the distance between the input pixels mapped to the output
     and the output pixel location.

.LEVEL1

.VARI INP
1. Filenames list.
2. Tiepoints list.

.VARI OUT
Superesolution image.

.VARI SCALE
Image magnification
factor.

.VARI RESOLUTION
Output pixel resolution.

.VARI MODE
1 = offset only
2 = 1st order polynomial

.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
Two input files:
1. An ascii list of filenames, one per record.
2. An ascii list of tiepoints created by vicar program REGISTER2.

.VARI OUT
The superresolution image.
You may need to deconvolve this image to make higher resolution apparent.
HALF format.

.VARI SCALE
Image magnification factor.
Sometimes an irrational number is better than an integer because it breaks up
standing patterns in the image. 
Defaults to 4.9

.VARI RESOLUTION
Output pixel resolution.
Each input pixel is projected into the output. It's distance R is measured from
the output target pixel. If R < RESOLUTION it is reset to = RESOLUTION. This
limits the sharpness of the output image but it stabilizes the output dn
values by limiting artifact due to poor registration.
Defaults to 0.5 (0.5 output pixel diameter). 

.VARI MODE
Type of registration polynomial permitted.
1 = offset only
2 = 1st order polynomial (affine)
(default is 2)
