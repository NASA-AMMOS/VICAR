VICAR Program HIST
.HELP
PURPOSE:
HIST prints DN-frequency histograms of one or more areas of an image.

EXECUTION:
	HIST  INP=PIC  user-parameters...
where
    PIC is a VICAR image of arbitrary size.  PIC may be in byte, halfword
    (16-bit integer), fullword (32-bit integer), floating-point (REAL*4),
    double precision (REAL*8) data format.  See FORMAT keyword.

PIC should normally reside on random access storage (e.g. magnetic disk)
to avoid the possibility of tape rewinding.  The exception is for byte
or halfword data where only one area is requested (see AREA parameter).

.page
OPERATION:

The format of the plotted histogram is specified via the MODE keyword.  Valid
values are NORMAL, WIDE, SCREEN, SPLOT, and NOHIST.  The DN axis may be plotted
vertically using 80 columns (NORMAL) or 132 columns (WIDE); or plotted
horizontally and formatted to fit on a standard 23x80 terminal screen (SCREEN).
SPLOT outputs a plot to a VT240 compatible terminal using the REGIS graphics
package.  The SCREEN mode works only on byte data, and the SPLOT mode will not
run in batch. 

The FORMAT keyword may be used to specify the data format of the input image.
If defaulted, the data format is determined from the input picture label.
Valid values are BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, and DOUB.

The DN-range displayed in the histogram may be specified using the LIMITS
parameter.  If defaulted, these limits are set to the minimum and maximum
DN values in the specified image area.

The number of lines (DN-levels) used to plot the output histogram is specified
by the NLINES parameter (default=256).

The 'PAUSE keyword introduces pauses every 23 lines to prevent the histogram
from scrolling off the terminal screen.

The computed mean and standard deviation of the input image may be output as
parameters which may be subsequently passed on to another program:
	LOCAL SD  TYPE=REAL		!Declare SD and AVG
	LOCAL AVG TYPE=REAL		!as local TAE variables
	HIST  PIC  SIGMA=SD  MEAN=AVG	!Compute SD and AVG
	PROG  PIC  STATS=(SD,AVG)	!Pass SD and AVG to program PROG

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINTED HISTOGRAM

The following is an example of a histogram printed using the 132-column (WIDE)
format:

The histogram consists of a bar graph, where the length of the bar at each DN
level is proportional to the number of pixels at that level.  The graph is
annotated on the left with a table of the frequency and cummulative distri-
bution function (CDF) at each DN-level.  The CDF is the percent count of all
pixels up to and including the given DN-level.  If the keyword 'NOCUM is
specified, this column changes to the percent count at that DN-level.
The CDF is not reported in the NORMAL screen format.

If there are pixels outside the DN-range specified by the LIMITS parameter,
these are indicated by the <LOW LIMIT and >HIGH LIMIT entries.

If the input data format is other than BYTE, the histogram is usually
compressed before display.  This is because the DN-range is normally larger
than can be displayed in the specified number of lines (NLINES parameter).
In these cases, the frequency displayed at a given DN-level represents the
number of pixels between that DN-level and the next higher DN-level in the
display.

For WIDE mode, histograms are preceded by an information line, such as:
FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION    SL=1  SS=1  NL=15  NS=15   LINC=  1    SINC=  1
If the SIZE field is specified, then the SL and SS values in this message
are computed relative to the subimage defined by the SIZE field.

Any zero entries in a wide or normal mode histogram are skipped in the
printout.  For wide mode, one or more consecutive zero entries is represented
by a single blank line in the histogram.  For normal mode, one or more 
consecutive zero entries is indicated by an * following the DN value
in the next line of the displayed histogram.

Examples

The following command prints out an 80-column-format histogram of input
image A:
	HIST  A 

The following command produces a line plot of the histogram using the
Regis graphics package.  It should only be run on a VT240 compatible terminal.
DN values are plotted along the x-axis, while frequencies are plotted along the
y-axis.
	HIST  A  'SPLOT

The following command will print out a histogram of the 15x15 pixel area in
the upper-left corner of image A.  The histogram will be plotted using a wide
(132 column) format:
	HIST  A  AREA=(1,1,15,15)  'WIDE

The following command will print two graphs in the narrow format using a
maximum of three hundred lines to represent the data:
	HIST  A  AREA=(1,1,15,15,100,100,10,40)  NLINES=300
Two histograms are plotted.  The first for the area (1,1,15,15) and the second
for the area (100,100,10,40).

The following command produces a histogram of image A for which only every
third sample of every second line will be read (for speed).
	HIST  A  SPIKES=3  LINC=2  SINC=3
SPIKES specifies that the 3 largest frequencies will be saturated.

specifies the input image file name.
.vari SIZE
SIZE specifies the portion of the input image which is to be processed by 
the program.  It consists of 4 integers:
	SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS)
where
	SL = starting line
	SS = starting sample
	NL = number of lines
	NS = number of samples
These can also be specified separately by the parameters SL, SS, NL, and NS.
See also AREA parameter.
.VARIABLE FORMAT
FORMAT specifies the input image data format.  Valid data formats are
BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, or DOUB.  If FORMAT is not specified, the data format is
determined from the image label.
.VARIABLE SPIKES
SPIKES=N specifies that the printed histogram will be normalized in frequency 
such that the N-th most frequent value is printed as the full width on 
the page.  All values which occur more frequently will also be represented 
by a full width bar, ranked by number on the right side. 

SPIKES may have any value from 1 to 9  (default=2 for NORMAL width, and 1 for
WIDE width).
.VARIABLE SINC
SINC=N specifies that every N-th sample in the specified area is to be used
in computing the histogram.  Default SINC=1.
Note that if INC is specified, this parameter is ignored.
.VARIABLE LINC
LINC=N specifies that every N-th line in the specified area is to be used
in computing the histogram.  Default LINC=1.
Note that if INC is specified, this parameter is ignored.
.VARIABLE INC
INC=N specifies that every N-th line and every N-th sample in the specified area
is to be used in computing the histogram.  Default INC=1.
This parameter overrides the SINC and LINC parameters.
.VARIABLE AREA
AREA specifies the area(s) of the input image which is/are for which histograms
are to be plotted.  If AREA is not specified, a histogram of the entire image
is computed.  The areas are specified as multiples of four integers:
	AREA=(SL1,SS1,NL1,NS1,SL2,SS2,NL2,NS2,...)
where
	SL1 = starting line of the first image area
        SS1 = starting line of the first image area
        NL1 = number of lines in the first image area
        NS1 = number of samples in the first image area
	ETC...
Up to 150 image areas may be specified.
If the SIZE field is entered as well, the AREA coordinates must be relative
to the subimage described by the SIZE field.
.VARIABLE MODE
MODE specifies the histogram plotting mode.  Valid values are:

    NORMAL - An 80 column wide histogram is printed with a vertical DN axis.
	     NORMAL is the default.
    WIDE   - A 132 column wide histogram is printed with a vertical DN axis.
    SCREEN - A 22 row by (up to) 80 column histogram is printed with a
 	     horizontally DN axis. This plot is designed to fit on a standard
	     80x22 terminal screen. BYTE is the only permissible data format
             for this option.
    SPLOT  - The histogram is plotted using the Regis graphics package with
             a horizontal DN-axis.  The plot is suitable for output to a
	     VT240 compatible terminal.  SPLOT is ignored in batch mode.
    NOHIST - No histogram is printed.  Only the statistical data for the
             image is reported: mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum
	     DN values, and total number of pixels.
.VARIABLE PPLOT
Keyword specifying histogram output to the HP plotter. PPLOT may be used with
any of the MODE options.  However, PPLOT is specified and MODE is defaulted,
no histogram is output to the terminal or log file.
.VARIABLE TITLE
Specifies a title to be placed beneath pen plots.  TITLE is ignored if PPLOT
is not specified. In addition, two other caption lines are always generated
for pen plots. One line contains the histogram statistics, while the other
lists the file name, area, linc, and sinc.
.vari NOCUM
NOCUM specifies that the percentages printed for each DN-level are the
percentage of the pixels at that DN-level.  The default is to display
the cummulative distribution function, which is the percentage of all pixels
at DN levels up to and including the current one.  Note that this
percentage is only reported in the WIDE format.
.VARIABLE NLINES
Specifies the maximum number of lines to be used in plotting the histogram.
The default is 256.
.VARIABLE LIMITS
LIMITS specifies the lower and upper bounds of the histogram.
If defaulted, these limits are set to the minimum and maximum
DN values in the specified image area, except for byte data,
for which the defaults are 0 and 255.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
Exclude 0 DN pixels from the mean and standard deviation values reported
at the end of the histogram. This does not affect the histogram itself.
.VARI PAUSE
PAUSE introduces pauses whenever the plot fills the terminal screen.
This parameter is ignored in batch mode. 
.VARI MEAN
This is an output parameter. When HIST has completed running, this parameter
contains the mean value of the last histogram. This value may be used by
subsequent programs within a procedure by declaring MEAN as a local real
variable in the procedure.
.VARI SIGMA
This is an output parameter. When HIST has completed running, this parameter
contains the value of the standard deviation for the last histogram. This 
value may be used by subsequent programs within a procedure by declaring 
SIGMA as a local real variable in the procedure.
