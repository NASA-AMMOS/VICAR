.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "ibisclst"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   "ibisclst" finds a cluster from a given dataset.  The dataset
that belong to the cluster will be marked with 1 and those that
do not will be marked with a 0 in the outcol of the "inp" ibis
file.

EXECUTION

    This program will break the datasets into corresponding
control numbers and cluster each set.

Clustering Algorithm:
   1. calculate distance for each datapoint to others - O(n^2)
   2. mark neighbors (adjacent points that lie w/i thresh radius)
   3. find the largest cluster by adding up connecting points
   4. mark the points that belong in the largest cluster

EXAMPLES
     ibisclst inp=data.ing col=(1,2,3) outcol=4 concol=5 thresh=10

    This example will find a cluster from the dataset specified by
the col parameter and write the output to the outcol parameter.
The clusters will be done for each control number specified by the
concol
