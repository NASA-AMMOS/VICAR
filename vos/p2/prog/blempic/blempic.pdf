VICAR2 PROGRAM "blempic"
.HELP
PURPOSE:

"blempic" creates images of the permanent blemishes, low-full-well
pixels, and total blemishes, as recorded in the blemish file output by
"blemgen".  The program is intended as a diagnostic tool for supporting
radiometric calibration of CCD camera systems and was initially written
for the Galileo project.

EXECUTION:

    Example:  blempic INP=BLEMFILE OUT=(PBLEM,SAT,TBLEM) NL=800 NS=800

where BLEMFILE is the input blemish file created by "blemgen", PBLEM is
an image of the permanent blemishes, SAT is an image of the low-full-well
pixels, and TBLEM is an image of all blemishes (permanent blemishes and
low-full-well pixels).  BLEM, SAT, and TBLEM are of size NLxNS (800x800
in this example).

All parameters are required.  The output picture format (NLxNS) should
be the same as the picture format of the camera.

OPERATION:

The image PBLEM contains a non-zero DN at the (line,sample) location of
each permanent blemish, and zeroes in the remaining pixels:

	DN(i,j) = 0    if the pixel at picture coordinate (i,j) is not
                       a permanent blemish.
	DN(i,j) = n    if the pixel is a permanent blemish of class n.
	DN(i,j) = 255  if the pixel is an unclassified permanent blemish.

See "blemgen" help file for blemish classification skeem.

The image SAT contains a non-zero DN at the (line,sample) location of
each low-full-well pixel, and zeroes in the remaining pixels:

	DN(i,j) = n    if the pixel saturates at DN=n.
        DN(i,j) = 0    if the pixel is normal or a permanent blemish.

The image TBLEM is similar to PBLEM (i.e. the DN values represent blemish
classification numbers) except that it includes all blemishes (permanent
blemishes and low-full-well pixels).  This image characterizes the case
of a high-exposure frame in which all low-full-well pixels are saturated.

"blempic" prints out the following statistics:

	1) number of permanent blemishes
	2) number of low-full-well pixels
	3) number of unclassified blemishes
	4) total number of blemishes
        5) histogram of the DN at which low-full-well pixels saturate
