.TITLE
concomp - find connected components (non-zero vs background 0) in image
.HELP
PURPOSE:
concomp uses connectivity defined by adjacency (not diagonal) of pixels
to turn an image into a connected component image.  Each connected
component receives a unique pixel number.  The input and output must be
halfword.

The highest numbered component can be output to a tcl variable named
LASTCMP.  The component numbering can also be started at a user selected
number with the parm STARTCMP.

EXECUTION:

Example

concomp A (B,WORK)      The image A will be turned into connected 
                        components in image B.  The WORK image is
                        needed for calcualtions and can be deleted.
                               
OPERATION:



TIMING: 

As fast as VICAR can read and write the lines.

name of a working image, to
be discarded later
.VARIABLE SIZE
Region of input file to be
operated on
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE THRESH
Components smaller than this
are discarded
.VARIABLE ZEDGE
