VICAR program bestscale
.HELP
PURPOSE:
To rescale images all the same size by geoming each image to match the 
first one. All geoms are centered at the image center and offer only 
differences in image size (magnification) about the center. The program
determines the amount of magnification.

example:
bestscale inp=(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5) out=(s1,s2,s3,s4,s5) scale=(.7,1.)
bestfocus inp=(s1,s2,s3,s4,s5) out=(focus,dtm) 'inverse

USAGE:
To get output images without black borders, order your input images such
that the image with the greatest magnification (smallest field of view)
is first. This way all images will be magnified and the data contents
of the output images will be about the same. Then your scale parameter
will go from a number less than 1 to 1. Example: scale=(.5,1.)

METHOD:
Bestscale finds the best scale by computing Pearson's R between the first input
and all the others. Each image is rescaled between the SCALE limits in
equal intervals until the best value of R is found. The best scale is then 
interpolated and the image geomed. Image 1 is copied to the first output.
Scale is the factor by which image structure is smaller or larger than it is
in the first input image.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
2-10 inputs

.VARI OUT
2-10 outputs

.VARI SCALE
1. lowest scale
2. highest scale

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
2-10 inputs. Input 1 is the reference image.

.VARI OUT
2-10 outputs. Output 1 is a copy of input 1.

.VARI SCALE
1. lowest scale
2. highest scale
The range of permitted scales over which the program may search.
Scale is the factor by which image structure is smaller or larger than it is
in the first input image.
The program searches for a scale between low scale and high scale. The program
selects the final scale by itself. A different scale is computed for each input
image. See USAGE section for hints on ordering the input images.
