.TITLE
Creates histogram file for halfword image
.HELP
PURPOSE:

"hiccup" (HIstogram Computation, Compression, and Printing) computes the
histogram, mean value, and standard deviation of one to three images and
outputs these values to one to three IBIS-2 format histogram files.  The
output histogram files are suitable for input to program GLLMASK.  The
histograms may also be printed.  See also programs "histgen" and "hist".

EXECUTION:

         hiccup  INP=PIC  OUT=HIS  user-parameters...
where

  PIC is the input images.
  HIS is the output histogram files.

PIC may be a byte image of up to 65536 samples in width or a halfword image
of up to 32768 samples in width.

HIS is in 32-bit integer data format and contains one line of 266 samples
(256 grey-level histogram + 10 statistical values).  See below for
documentation of the histogram file format.

OPERATION:

The histogram is computed from the input image.  If the input image is in
halfword data format, the following processing steps are performed:

  1) A histogram containing 64K grey-levels (ranging from -32768 to +32767 DN)
     is first computed.  In computing this histogram, all input pixels at
     -32768 DN are ignored (for some missions, this value is a flag which
     indicates missing or invalid data).  The 'INCLUDE keyword may be used
     to include -32768 DN in the histogram.

  2) The resulting histogram is compressed so that it contains 256 grey-levels.

The histogram compression is accomplished via one of three types of scales:

  1) If the keyword 'scale' is IOF, the histogram is scaled to units of
     IOF times a computed scale factor, chosen so that:
	(a) the maximum input DN value is scaled to a value that is greater
            than 128 but less than 256.
        (b) 256 on the output scale is some convenient IOF unit (one of the
            digits 1,2,4, or 5 multiplied by a power of 10).

  2) If the keyword 'scale' is RADIANCE, the histogram is scaled to units
     of nanowatts/cm**2/steradian/nanometer times some convenient scale
     chosen as in IOF above.

  3) If neither IOF or RADIANCE are specified, the input DNs are divided
     by some power of 2, chosen so that the maximum input DN value is scaled
     to a value that is greater than 128 but less than 256.

In each of these three methods of scaling, all negative DNs are set equal
to 0 DN.

If IOF or RADIANCE is specified, the input image must be a Voyager ISS or
Galileo SSI image that has been radiometrically corrected, and on which no
subsequent filters or stretches have been applied to alter the scale of the
radiometric units.  The radiometric scale of the input image is retrieved by
reading the input flight label.

The keyword 'PHIST causes the output histogram to be printed.  The SPIKES
and 'ZEROES parameters control this printout.

.page
OUTPUT HISTOGRAM FILE FORMAT:

The output histogram consists of a single-column IBIS-2 file (the column
group named 'HISTOGRAM').  In addition, the following statistical data is 
computed and stored in the STATISTICS property label:

   SCALE_TYPE='IOF'   (or 'RADIANCE' or 'NONE')
   OUTPUT_HISTOGRAM_SCALE=0.00390625
   PERCENT_SATURATION_AT_LOW_VALUE=5.7684
   PERCENT_SATURATION_AT_HIGH_VALUE=0.0
   MAXIMUM_FREQUENCY=43603
   NUMBER_OF_PIXELS_IN_HISTOGRAM=640000
   NUMBER_OF_LEVELS_IN_HISTOGRAM=256
   MEAN_VALUE=0.0246134
   STANDARD_DEVIATION_VALUE=0.0988648

If the SCALE_TYPE is 'IOF' and the OUTPUT_HISTOGRAM_SCALE is 0.00390625, then
the increment between histogram levels is 0.00390625 IOF.  Note that
256*0.00390625 = 1.0 IOF.

If IOF or RADIANCE are specified, the mean and standard deviation are in
units of IOF or radiance.  Otherwise, they are in units of DN in the input
image.

The maximum frequency reported excludes the low and high DN values.

PROGRAM HISTORY:

Written by: Gary Yagi		January 1, 1990
Cognizant programmer: Gary Yagi
Revisions:
  10 APR 90  GMY   Correct LSAT and HSAT for byte inputs.
  27 APR 92  GMY   Change EDR test file to VENUS1.IMG, add PCA
   5 SEP 94  AMS(CRI) Made portable for UNIX, and changed to IBIS-2 output.
  18 NOV 96  JRY   Changed the number of outputs to equal the number of inputs,
		   putting each histogram in a separate file.
  03 FEB 97  JRY   Fixed the vicar label of the output files to be the same
		   as it's corresponding input file.
  03 Feb 98  GMY   Fixed simultaneous scaling of 3 histograms.  Fixed error
                   in reporting the scaling (Package=HICCUP_COLOR).  Added
                   'USECOW keyword.
  11 Feb 98  GMY   Fix 'USECOW on UNIX.
