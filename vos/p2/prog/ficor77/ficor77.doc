This document contains information useful to the programmer responsible
for maintaining and modifying the VICAR program FICOR77.  Read the Help
and PDF files first.

HISTORY:
-------
FICOR77 is a modification of the Mariner 9 program FICOR.  It was implemented
on the IBM by Joel Mosher in time for the Voyager-Jupiter encounters.  It
was converted to the VAX by M. Kendall and Bob Barrey at University College,
London.  Florence Moss did the VICAR2 conversion and wrote the LCOR pixel loop
in MACRO.  Major changes were made in Feb 1988 by Gary Yagi to clean up the
code and add the FIXVGR scale correction.

OPERATION:
---------
    ficor77 INP=(PIC,C1,C2,...,DC1,DC2,...) OUT=OPIC user-parameters...
where
    PIC	is the image to be radiometrically corrected (byte)
    C1,...  one or more radiometric calibration files (byte or halfword)
    DC1,...	one or more dark-current frames (byte or halfword)
    OPIC is the radiometrically corrected image (byte,half,or real)

Files PIC,CAL,DC and OPIC are referenced by logical unit numbers IUNIT,IUNITC,
IUNITD, and OUNIT, respectively.


DESCRIPTION OF SUBROUTINES:
--------------------------
FICOR77 executes these subroutines (in the order listed):

IPOPEN    --Open PIC and extract camera parameters from label
PLANETID  --Determine planet-of-encounter from user params, PICNO, SCET, or ERT.
OPOPEN    --Open OPIC and process keywords NONEG,MAXDN,BYTE,REAL
CPARAM    --Process camera keywords EXPO,FILTER,SCAN,CAMERA,GAIN,etc.
FSEARCH   --Scan input file list for calibration file and dark-current
	    frame which matches PIC (Call them CAL and DC).
	    Call PLABEL to print CAL and DC image labels and summary of
	    camera parameters.
IPSCALE   --Generate look-up table LUT and scale factor DCSCALE to scale the
	    input DNs to equivalent units as the calibration file data samples.
OPSCALE   --Scale the luminances (LTBL) to output units (I/F or nanowatts).
	      1) Compute adjustment for shutter speed (to/t)
	      2) Call FTLAMBERT to get conversion factors from Ft-L to I/F
		 or nanowatts (S1 or S2).
	      3) Get user-specified scale (A1 or A2).
	      4) Call FIXSCALE to get FIXVGR scale correction (S)
	      5) Apply 1-4 to LTBL
	    Compute difference table DTBL
FCOSET	  --Pass LTBL, DTBL and other constants to LCOR
FICOR     --Loops through each image line, calling LCOR to perform the
	    radiometric correction.
FCOEND    --Retrieve processing statistics from LCOR.
OLABEL    --Add radiometric scale information to output image label.

The subroutine CORRECT is called by FIXSCALE to access the SCF.
The subroutine GETLABX (which gets the VICAR1 label) is called by IPOPEN
and FSEARCH.

Subroutine convention: The input arguments of a subroutine almost always
appear first, and in UPPER CASE, followed by the updated and output
arguments in lower case.

FCOSET, FCOR, and FCOEND are entry points to the Macro subroutine FCOR.
The old Macro equivalent to the FORTRAN code in the subroutine FCOR, was
replaced due to not being portable.

CAMERA PARAMETERS:
-----------------
The camera parameters for the input image and dark-current frame are
maintained in arrays IPIC(39) and IDARK(8), as returned by ABLE77V2, where:

	 IPIC(N)          VARIABLE
	 -------	  --------
	    1             On input, number of parameters to be returned
	    2             FDS count (frame number)
	    3             Exposure time (msec)
	    4             Filter position (0-7)
	    5             Scan rate (=5 if 5:1)
	    6             Camera serial number
	    7             Camera (NA=1,WA=2)
	    8             Gain (low=0,high=1)
	   10		  SCET year
	   21-22	  PICNO
	   35		  ERT year

RADIOMETRIC FILE:
----------------
The radiometric (or calibration) file contains data in labels and data
records containing light-transfer data (in DN) for each pixel of the
image.  The data in the labels is as follows:

	NC = number of data points on curve.
	CNS = number of samples per data record.
	EMAX = default relative ft-L to DN scaling factor
	LTBL(i) = luminance of data point i at reference shutter speed in
               relative ft-L, for i=1,NC

The data points are stored in the data records as vector of the form
(s(1),s(2),...,s(NC)) where s(i) is the pixel output at luminance LTBL(i)
for the reference shutter speed.  The current Voyager calibration file
uses a curve with 10 data points.  The first point is always zero (zero
exposure level).  Each data record contains 3200 data points, or enough
for 320 pixels of the input image.
