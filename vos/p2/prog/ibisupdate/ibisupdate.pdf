.TITLE
IBISUPDATE - Copy corrected camera pointing from IBIS SEDR file to
      SPICE C-kernel

.HELP
IBISUPDATE is a VICAR program which copies corrected camera pointing data
from an IBIS SEDR file to a SPICE C-kernel.  IBISUPDATE is one of a suite
of programs used primarily for creating digital mosaics.  The program
currently works for Galileo SSI only.

EXECUTION:

  IBISUPDATE INP=ibisfile  TARGET=targetname  user-parameters...
where
  INP is the input IBIS SEDR file, and
  TARGET is the name of the planet, satellite, or asteroid in the image.

The IBIS SEDR file is originally created by IBISNAV, and later updated with
corrected pointing via OMCOR2.

.page
OPERATION:

The data for each image is read from the IBIS SEDR file.  If the SCET parameter
is specified, the records matching the input SCETs are processed.  Otherwise,
all records in the IBIS SEDR file are processed.  Processing consists extracting
the camera pointing and storing it in the MIPS C-kernel MIPS_NEAR.CK.

To later access the updated navigation information with programs like
MAP2, the user should use the CKNAME parameter with a value of NEAR.

.page
LOCAL AND REMOTE SPICE ACCESS:

Corrected camera pointing may be stored in local or remote (e.g. at JPL) SPICE
C-kernels.  Remote access is via a SPICE server.

SPICEMODE specifies whether local or remote SPICE access is to be used.
If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value of the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE.

PARAMETERS FOR STORING THE IMPROVED CAMERA POINTING:

The following optional parameters are used to store provenance information along
with the improved (C-Smithed) camera pointing computed by the program.  This
provenance information is stored in the (C kernel) segment identifier for the
camera pointing data.  In cases where there are several versions of camera
pointing for an image in a given C kernel, this provenance information can
later be used to retrieve a specific instance of camera pointing from the
kernel.

PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode) for further details.

Example:  'REMOTE INSTITUTE=DLR USERID=TYR stores the improved camera pointing
          via the SPICE server.  Provenance data regarding the facility (DLR)
          and user (Thomas Roatsch) who created the data is included.

GALILEO'S FULL FRAME MODE AND SUMMATION MODE

In conformance to new convention, the CAMERA s/n for GLL is now used to specify
Full Frame Mode (if s/n = 1) or Summation Mode (if s/n = 2).  If the CAMERA
is not specified the program defaults CAMERA to Full Frame Mode (s/n = 1).

.page
EXAMPLES:

             IBISNAV out=IB.SDR  user-parameters...

                ( run OMCOR )

             IBISUPDATE IB.SDR  TARGET=JUPITER CAM=5 'UPDATE +
                     PROJECT=VGR-1
     -or-    IBISUPDATE IB.SDR  TARGET=JUPITER 'UPDATE +

.level2
.vari INP
String
Name of the input IBIS SEDR file.

.VARI PROJECT
The project ID.

.VARI OBJECT
Specifies whether the data is in OBJECT space (geometricaly corrected) or
IMAGE space (uncorrected).

IMAGE (uncorrected) is only valid for GLL project.
.VARI SCET
The spacescraft event time for each image.  Required only for GLL project.
If omitted the scet times will be extracted from columns 32-37 in the input
ibis file. Groups of 6 integers for each image in the order:
Year, day, hour, minute, second, milisecond.
.vari MODE
Keyword
Indicator of whether to update or not update the Voyager SEDR file.  
        Valid: UPDATE and NOUPDATE.  Default: NOUPDATE.
.vari CAMERA
Array of Integers
The serial number of the camera which took all images.
By default the program will obtain the cameras from the input IBIS file.
This parameter is used to override the camera s/n specified in the IBIS table.

If the override is desired on the n-th record, all cameras from the first
record up to the n-th are to be specified.

For GLL's case, which actually has only one camera, this parameter specifies if
an image was taken in Full Frame Mode (CAMERA = 1) or Summation Mode (CAMERA = 
2).

.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  A complete list of valid
target names is located in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or
environmental variable) BODY_IDS.
If defaulted, the target is retrieved from the VICAR label or other TBD means.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be accessed from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be accessed
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.

Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode, the other mode
is attempted in order to retrieve SPICE data.  However, when improved camera
pointing data is stored, only the specified or default mode is used.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which creates
the improved (C-Smithed) camera pointing.  If defaulted, the value of the
logical name (or environmental variable) VICAR_SITE is used.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=ASU identifies ASU as the creator of the improved camera
     pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.  REQNUM must contain exactly 4 digits.

Ex:  REQNUM=0123 identifies (somewhat) request number R000123

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.
The date string must contain exactly 12 digits.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.

If defaulted, the current date and time is used.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group of the user
running this program to store improved camera pointing.  (The user ID is
automatically determined by the program).

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

On VMS, this parameter is ignored since the program automatically determines
the group ID of the current user.

If GROUPID is defaulted on Unix, the program uses the value of the
environmental variable GROUPID.  Note that GROUPID is not a system-defined
variable, and should be defined in your .cshrc as in the following example:

Ex:  setenv GROUPID 040
.end
