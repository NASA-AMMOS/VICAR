 tfilt  --  threshold filtering.
.HELP
PURPOSE:

tfilt is a VICAR program which performs various boxfilter type convolutional
filters.  It is a commonly used, especially in planetary image processing. 
tfilt is often used to bring out detail that is not noticeable in the original
image.  tfilt is able to ignore DN's below a threshold when computing the low
pass average and is thus free of ringing in certain cases.  (See the threshold
effects section below.)   Scaling allows the dynamic range of high pass filters
to be improved before integer truncation. 
.PAGE
EXECUTION:

tfilt is executed as a standard VICAR program.  The following 
VICAR command line formats show the most common usages:

      tfilt INP=a OUT=(b,x) SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      tfilt INP=a OUT=(b,x) SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns optional parameters
      tfilt a (b,x) (sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters
      tfilt a (b,x) optional parameters

       Here 'a' represents the input image file name, 
       'x' represents a scratch file name, and
       'b' represents the output image file name.

If the primary input is a multi-band image, then three output files
are required, of which the last two are scratch files, e.g.:

      tfilt a (b,x,y) optional parameters

.PAGE
USER INFORMATION:

The size of the output image is determined by the the SIZE field if the SIZE
field is entered by the user.  If the SIZE field is not entered, the output
file is the same size as the input file. 

The data type of the input image may be any valid format of 4 or fewer bytes
per pixel.  The data type is obtained from the VICAR label of the input image.
The output image has the same data format as the input image. 

.page
Available Filter Types:

tfilt can be used to apply a high pass, a low pass, a scene dependent, or
a divide filer to an image.  Each type of filter can be thought of as 
emphasizing one aspect of the image and de-emphasizing another aspect of
the image.  tfilt has a variety of uses in image restoration and
image enhancement.  The major charactistics of each of these filters are
described below.

1)  The high pass filter emphasizes high frequency information and
    de-emphasizes low frequency information.  (High frequency means
    brightness changing rapidly as a function of distance.  Low frequency
    means brightness changing slowly as a function of distance.)  The high
    pass filter can be used to compensate for variations in illumination
    between different areas of the image due to sun angle differences.  It
    can also be used to make the picture sharper, to emphasize edges of
    features, and to enhance fine detail.  Often the high pass filter will
    bring out small scale structure that is not noticeable in the original
    image.  The high pass filter tends to remove variations due to color
    differences (albedo variations). The high pass filter can emphasize
    noise if present, so it is best to remove noise before performing a
    high pass filter.  If there are reseau marks in the image, they should
    be removed with program RESSAR77 or a similar program before a high
    pass filter is performed. 
    
2)  The low pass filter emphasizes low frequency information and
    de-emphasizes high frequency information.  The low pass filter is used
    mainly for smoothing the brightness variations in the image.  It can be
    used to smooth noise in a noisy or grainy image to make it less
    noticeable.  The low pass filter makes edges and features blurred or
    smoother. 
    
3)  The scene dependent filter is a variant of the high pass filter that
    can be useful in dealing with images having nonhomogeneous illumination
    or images with mixtures of areas with little high frequency detail and
    areas with a lot of high frequency detail.  It is called a scene
    dependent filter because it compensates for dark areas by dividing the
    high frequency information by the average brightness of the surrounding
    area.  Thus it emphasizes high frequency information especially in
    darker areas of the image, and de-emphasizes low frequency information
    especially in brighter areas of the image. The scene dependent filter
    has similar properties to the high pass filter (enhancing detail), but
    compensates more for the darker areas of the image. The MIPL facility
    at JPL has a display showing the use of the scene dependent filter on
    an image of Mercury with only part of the planet illumined by the sun. 
    The scene dependent filter improves feasture discriminability near the
    edge of the illumined portion of the planet. 
    
4)  The divide filter amplifies darker parts of the image and scales down
    brighter parts of the image, preserving the contrast and evening out
    the overall intensity across the image.  It is useful for bringing out
    subtle detail, especially in darker parts of the image. The divide
    filter can be used to compensate for variations in illumination between
    different areas of the image due to sun angle differences.  The divide
    filter tends to remove variations due to color differences (albedo
    variations). The divide filter tends to pass random noise without
    adding emphasis. 
.page
Selection of Filter Type:

The most commonly used of the four filter types is the high pass filter. This is
partly because people like to see a lot of detail and imaging systems often
attenuate higher frequency information.  (See reference 2.) The high pass
filter also compensates for variations in illumination in the image. The divide
filter is also commonly used.  It compensates for variations in illumination in
the image without emphasizing high frequency information.  It can bring out
detail in the image and in some cases produces a result quite similar to the
high pass filter.  The scene dependent filter is less commonly used.  It is
recommended when the results of the high pass filter are not satisfactory
because of inhomogeneity in the image.  The low pass filter has a very
different purpose from the other three filter types, namely smoothing the data.
VICAR program BOXFLT2 is also used for low pass filtering
and has some different methods for handling the edges of the image.
.page
Advantages and Disadvantages:

tfilt has both good and bad features.  It is fast for a filter program, 
If the threshold is chosen well, tfilt can do a good filtering job without 
causing noticeable ringing near edges.  It is not an optimal filter, though, 
and sometimes it can generate ringing problems.  This is because it uses a 
uniform set of filter weights.(See reference 1.)  The VICAR program FILTER is 
recommended for users wishing to do more optimal filtering.  FILTER can be 
much slower than tfilt, though. FILTER requires the user specify the filter 
weights.  There is, however, a default set of weights in FILTER.  VICAR 
procedure FILTER2 can be used to generate the weights alternatively.
 
.page
Threshold Effects:

Linear filtering with a uniform set of weights can often cause ringing
in the output image, especially around a sharp edge.  The threshold (THRESH)
parameter allows tfilt to filter without causing noticeable ringing in many
cases.  In planetary image processing, the most distinct edge in a picture
is often the boundary (limb) between a planet or moon (satelite) and the
black of outer space.  For such an image the threshold should be set 
slightly below the brightness of the planet so that basically all of the
planet is brighter than the threshold and the black of outer space is
darker than the threshold. Unfortunately, finding a threshold that minimizes
ringing can be a matter of trial and error.  A histogram may be of value in
picking an initial value. 
.page
Effects of Box Size:

For all filter types the box size (parameters NLW and NSW) affects the
output.  For a low pass filter a small box (3 by 3 to 11 by 11) is usually used.
For the other filter types a large box is generally used since this
produces a less grainy image and less noise enhancement than a smaller box.
A large box can cause greater ringing than a small box, though, especially
if the threshold parameter is not set optimally.  For an 800 by 800 
Voyager image a box size in the range 15 by 15 to 75 by 75 is common.
The exact size is not too important.  A square is commonly used for
symmetry.  Because of the algorithm used by tfilt, the box size does not affect
the execution time significantly.  (A 75 by 75 box took five percent more time
than a 5 by 5 box.) 
.page
Effects of the DC Transmission Factor (DCTRAN):

The DCTRAN parameter is used to soften the effect of the selected filter by
making the output image a combination of the filter output and the input
image.  DCTRAN can be used with all of the filter types except low pass.
DCTRAN is commonly set to make the output image about 70 percent from
the filter and 30 percent from the input image.  (For the high pass filter
you can try DCTRAN = 0.1 to 0.2.)  The DC in DCTRAN stands for direct
current.  This stems from the connection of filtering with signal processing
theory.  DCTRAN reflects the amount of the original signal that is
transmitted by the filter.  When DCTRAN is used with the high pass filter or 
scene dependent filter, the output image will retain some low 
frequency information, and albedo and illumination variations will still be
present to some degree. 
.page
Control of Dynamic Range:

Each of the filter types uses some parameters to control the dynamic
range of DNs in the output image.  The default values for these
parameters can sometimes produce a narrow dynamic range, especially
with byte data, resulting in image degradation when integer truncation
takes place.  Some recommendations on these parameters are given below
for byte data, but a lot depends on the input image, and some trial
and error may be appropriate until satisfactory results are produced.
(For trial and error, try tfilt on a small portion of the 
image and run VICAR program HIST with BINS=20 to check the dynamic
range of the output image.)

For the high pass filter, try BOOST=4, and default DCLEVEL.  Default DCTRAN if a
straight high pass filter is desired or try DCTRAN = .1 to .2 to soften 
the filter.

For the scene dependent filter, try SCALE in the range 100 to 300 and default
DCLEVEL. Default DCTRAN if a straight scene dependent filter is desired or try
DCTRAN = .1 to .2 to soften the filter. 

For the low pass filter the defaults for BOOST and OFFSET should be
satisfactory.

For the divide filter, try OFFSET in the range 0 to 50, and default DCLEVEL.  
Default DCTRAN if a straight divide filter is desired or try 
DCTRAN = .1 to .2 to soften the filter.

 OPERATION
    
tfilt operates as a convolutional filter.  At each pixel it computes the
average of all DN's greater than the THRESH parameter within an area of
dimensions NLW by NSW centered on that pixel and performs the filter using this
value.  Values of pixels outside the image are obtained by reflection about the
image edges. 

If the local average is ADN, the pixel at the center of the averaged area is
DN, and the output pixel DN is OUT, then the four filters are: 
 
 HIGH     OUT=(DN-ADN)*BOOST+DCTRAN*DN+DCLEVEL
 SCENE    OUT=((DN-ADN)/ADN)*SCALE+DCTRAN*DN+DCLEVEL
 LOW      OUT=ADN*BOOST+OFFSET
 DIVIDE   OUT=(DN/ADN)*SCALE+DCTRAN*DN+OFFSET

Default values for the constants are:
 
 SCALE = 100.0,  DCTRAN = 0.0,  BOOST = 1.0,
 DCLEVEL= 128.0,  OFFSET = 0.5

The calculations are performed in floating-point arithmetic and then truncated
to the output format if necessary.  For SCENE and DIVIDE,
1.0 is used in the denominator if ADN is 0.  The results of the calculations
are checked for being in the valid range of DNs for the data type
of the image and are adjusted if invalid.  For byte data, DNs less
than 0 are set to 0, and DNs greater than 255 are set to 255.  For halfword
data, DNs less than -32768 are set to -32768, and DNs greater than 32767 are
set to 32767.  For fullword integer and real*4 data, the limits are set by
default to (-1.0E10, +1.0E10), but may be changed using the LIMITS parameter.
.PAGE
TIMING: 

tfilt takes about 23 CPU seconds on the VAX 8600 for a high pass filter 
on an 800 by 800 byte image.  Because of the algorithm used by tfilt,
the box size does not affect the execution time significantly.  (A 75 by
75 box took five percent more time than a 5 by 5 box.)

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 input file
.VARIABLE OUT
 output file and one or two scratch files

 If the primary input is multi-band, then three output files are required
 of which the last two are scratch files.  Otherwise, only one scratch
 file is required, which is the second output file.

 The first output file is always the output image.

.VARIABLE SIZE
 (number of lines,number of samples,
 starting line number,starting sample number)
 Specifies area of input image to process.
.VARI SL
Starting line.
.VARI SS
Starting sample.
.VARI NL
Number of lines.
.VARI NS
Number of samples per line.
.VARIABLE NLW
 NLW is an integer which specifies the number of lines dimension
 of the convolution window.

 The default is NLW=NL/10 where NL is the number of lines in the size field.
 If NLW is an even number (whether user-specified or default), then 1 is
 added to get an odd number.  E.g., for a 100x100 image, the default is
 NLW=11.
.VARIABLE NSW
 NSW is an integer which specifies the number of pixels dimension of the
 convolutional window.  The default is NL/10.

 If NLW is an even number (whether user-specified or default), then 1 is
 added to get an odd number.  
.VARIABLE THRESH
 THRESH is an integer which specifies a threshold
 level above which pixels will be accepted into
 the average (low pass).  When a pixel lies 
 below THRESH the output picture pixel will
 always be zero.  The default is THRESH=0,
 which, at least for byte, converts tfilt into
 a linear boxfilter.

(NOTE:  until 20-Dec-2012, the default for THRESH was
-1 and the criterion for exclusion was DN<=THRESH.  This
was changed when support for REAL*4 data was added, to
make the behaviour at THRESH=0 consistent with integer
data types.  As a result, to obtain the same results as
the older version of THRESH, 1 must be added to the old
value.)
.VARIABLE FILTER
 This parameter specifies the type of filter to be used.
 
 HIGH: performs a high pass filter using the following equation:
 	OUT = (DN-AVGDN)*BOOST+DCTRAN*DN+DCLEVEL
 
 SCENE: performs a SCENE filter using the following equation:
	OUT = (DN-AVGDN)/ADVDN*SCALE+DCTRAN*DN+DCLEVEL
 
 LOW:  performs a low pass filter using the following equation:
	OUT = AVGDN*BOOST+OFFSET
 
 DIVIDE: performs a divide filter using the following equation:
	OUT = DN/AVGDN*SCALE+DCTRAN*DN+OFFSET
	 This is the default filter.
.VARIABLE SCALE
 SCALE is a real number, used to scale output for SCENE and
 DIVIDE filters only.  The default is 100.
.VARIABLE DCTRAN
 DCTRAN is a real, DC transmission. Default = 0.0  (See the section on 
 DCTRAN in the main help section for tfilt.)
.VARIABLE BOOST
 BOOST is a real number, used to scale output for HIGH and LOW
 filters only.   Default is 1.0
.VARIABLE DCLEVEL
 DCLEVEL is a real additive factor in SCENE and HIGH filters only.
 Default is 128.0
.VARIABLE OFFSET
 OFFSET is a real additive factor used with
 LOW and DIVIDE filters only. (Default = 0.5)
