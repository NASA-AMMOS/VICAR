PURPOSE:
   GRID superimposes a grid network on a byte data set.   The grid consists
of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines.  Each grid line will have 
long and short tick marks (fiducial marks) somewhat like the long and short
marks on a ruler between the lines for each inch.  The details of the grid are
as follows:

   1.  The intensity of the pixels in the network is given by the 
       intensity parameters. 
   2.  Every BLI lines and samples, a one-pixel-wide line is superimposed
       over the data set.
   3.  A (long) mark of length (2 * LFL + 1) pixels is placed across each 
       grid line every LFS pixels.
   4.  A (short) mark of length (2 * SFL + 1) pixels is placed across each 
       grid line every SFS pixels.

       Remark: Intensity parameters,BLI,LFL,SFL,LFS,SFS are defined in 
               the parameter section in TUTOR mode.

EXECUTION:
   The followings are the possible execution statements for 'GRID'.
 
    1. GRID A B 

       where A is an input data set, B is an output data set.
       This will cause a grid network of intensity 255, aligned with
       the reference marks. The default for GEO is (100,25,5,2,1), 
       meaning:
       a)  The lines of the grid are spaced every 100 pixels.
       b)  The long tick marks are spaced every 25 pixels and are 5
           pixels in length.
       c)  The short tick marks are spaced every 5 pixels and are 3
           pixels in length.

    2. GRID A B SIZE=(1,1,100,100) INT=(0,0,100,0)
   
       This will cause the size of the output data set to be 100 lines
       by 100 samples. And all pixels in the network have resultant
       values which are modulo(255,(original value)+100).


    3. GRID A B INT=(0,200,0,100) GEO=(50,30,5,2,1)
       
       This will cause intensity value in the network specified by
       GEO parameters to be multipled by 2 and then taken modulo 255.
       Since LIMIT parameter is specified, if the resultant value is 
       less than the limit or greater than (255-limit), then it is set
       equal to limit or (255-limit) respectively.
 

    4. GRID A B REP=100 BLI=50

       This will cause a grid network of intensity 255 with the basic
       line interval to be every 50 samples.

.VARI INT
INT [intensity parameters]

    The intensity parameters may be specified by two ways.  Each
 keyword may be followed by an integer, or all values may be specified
 as INT=(x,x,x,x), where (x,x,x,x) refer to the values for REP, MUL,
 ADD, and LIM, respectively.
    The first parameter is the replace (REP) value, the second is the multiply
(MUL) value,  the third is the add (ADD) value and the last one is the limit
(LIM) value (all defined  later).  Replace, multiply and add may not be used
together.  And  limit may be used only with multiply. 
    The keywords are as follows:
 
	1. REP --     causes 'GRID' to replace the DN value of all pixels
		      in the network with a constant DN.  If no other
		      intensity parameters are specified, all pixels in
		      the network are replaced by 255.

	2. MUL --     causes 'GRID' to multiply each pixel in the overlay
 		      by a constant which is 1/100 of the integer value.
		      The value of the pixel is then set equal to the 
		      product, modulo 256.  If the LIMIT parameter has
		      been specified, and the value is less than the of
		      LIMIT or greater than the value of (255-LIMIT),
		      it is set equal to LIMIT or (255-LIMIT) respectively.
		      If LIMIT value is not specified when MULTIPLY value
		      has been set, LIMIT is set to 64.

	3. ADD --     causes 'GRID' to add a constant value to the DN
		      of each pixel in the overlay network.  The resulting
		      value, modulo 256, is used in the output.

	4. LIM --     see explanation of MULTIPLY.

.VARI GEO
 GEO [geometric parameters]
    
    'GRID' operates under the control of geometric parameters, which
 control grid spacing and line length.  GEO parameters may be assigned
 by two ways.  Each keyword may be followed by an integer, or all value
 may be specified as GEO=(x,x,x,x,x), where (x,x,x,x,x) refer to the values
 for BLI, LFS, SFS, LFL, and SFL, respectively.    The keywords are as follows:

	1. BLI -- the basic line interval (spacing) for the grid.  The
		  default is 100.

 	2. LFS -- the long fiducial spacing (i.e.,the spacing
		  between the long fiducial marks perpendicular to the 
		  grid lines).  The default is 25.

	3. SFS -- the short fiducial spacing (i.e., the spacing
		  between the short fiducial marks perpendicular to the
		  grid lines).  The default is 5.   

  	4. LFL -- the length of the long marks.  Actual total
		  length will be (2 * LFL + 1), across the grid lines.
		  The default is 2.

	5. SFL -- the length of the short marks.  Actual
		  total length will be (2 * SFL + 1), across the grid lines.
		  The default is 1.
