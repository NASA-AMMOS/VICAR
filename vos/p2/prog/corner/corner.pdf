VICAR Program CORNER

PURPOSE

Program CORNER is a VICAR/IBIS applications program which is used to 
find good locations for tiepoints in an image.  CORNER looks 
for the corners of objects or features in the image.

EXECUTION

Program CORNER looks for corners of objects or features in the input image.  
A corner is defined as a bend or curve in an edge.  An edge is defined as a 
contour line of brightness (DN) having a large brightness gradient relative
to neighboring contour lines.  

Program CORNER scans the image looking for edge pixels.  When an edge pixel is
found, CORNER checks if the edge is bent at that pixel.  This is done by 
sampling the image along the line perpendicular to the gradient and checking
for a local minimum or maximum at the pixel that was found.  If there is such
a local minimum or maximum, CORNER considers the pixel to be a corner.  The
sharpness or quality of the corner is measured by the absolute value of the
second derivative of brightness as a function of position along the line
perpendicular to the gradient.  (The first derivative is 0 at a local 
minimum or maximum.)  The scanning algorithm is designed more for speed than
thoroughness and consequently does not find all corners of features.

CORNER divides the input image into NAV rows (and NAH columns) of rectangular
cells.  CORNER uses the portion of the input image defined by the SIZE
parameter, minus any border specified by the BORDER  parameter.  For each
rectangular cell, CORNER finds the corner of greatest quality. 

The algorithm used for finding corners has two parameters that can be used to 
adjust the program's response to noise in the image and to features or objects
of differing sizes.  The GTHRESH parameter is used roughly as a gradient
magnitude threshold for edge detection.  If GTHRESH is defaulted, the program 
automatically computes a threshold based on the brightness variation in the
image.  The WIDTH parameter determines the size of the interval over which the
gradient and second derivative are computed.  The larger the WIDTH parameter,
the less the program pays attention to noise and fine detail.

The data type of the input image may either be byte or halfword data.  The data
type is obtained from the VICAR label of the input image. 

The output file is an IBIS interface file.  (See the DCL HELP on IBISFIL.)
This IBIS interface file has three columns, all with length NAH*NAV.  Each
column is stored in REAL*4 format.  The IBIS interface file has one row for
each rectangular cell.  The first two columns contain the line and sample
coordinates for the corner of greatest quality in the cell.  The third
columns contain the quality of the corners.  The quality is approximately the
absolute value of the second derivative of brightness.  This value is not 
normalized, but the larger the quality, the more distinct the corner.
If no corner is found in a given rectangular cell,  all three values are 0.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:

      corner INP=a OUT=b SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters.
      corner INP=a OUT=b SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns optional parameters.
      corner INP=a OUT=b (sl,ss,nl,ns) optional parameters.
      corner INP=a OUT=b optional parameters.

       Here 'a' represents the input image file name,
       and 'b' represents the output IBIS interface file name.

EXAMPLES

1.    corner INP=A OUT=B WIDTH=10 BORDER=32

      In this example CORNER divides the image into 25 (the default)
      rectangular pieces and finds the best corner location in each piece.
      All locations found will be more than 32 pixels from the edge of the
      image so that these locations can be used for FFT correlation by another
      program.  The WIDTH parameter is set so that image noise and most 
      features much less than 10 pixels in diameter will be ignored.

.PAGE
 RESTRICTIONS
1. The input image must be byte or halfword data.
2. The maximum number of pixels per line is 60000.  The number of pixels 
   per line times (2*WIDTH + 1) must not exceed 300,000.
3. The maximum number for NAH or NAV is 1000.
4. The WIDTH parameter must be in the range 1 to 50.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input image.
.VARIABLE OUT
Output IBIS interface file name.
.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard Vicar size field:
  (SL,SS,NL,NS)
You can enter SL,SS,NL,
and NS together as SIZE, OR
enter the SL,SS,NL, and NS
parameters separately.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line number
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample number
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE WIDTH
Width of interval used for
corner finding.
.VARIABLE GTHRESH
Gradient threshold used for
corner finding.
.VARIABLE NAH
Number of columns of rectangles
to divide image into.
.VARIABLE NAV
Number of rows of rectangles
to divide image into.
.VARIABLE THRESH
Threshold for finding edge of
imge data.
.VARIABLE BORDER
Border width.
.VARIABLE PRINT
Enter 'NOPRINT for no printed
output.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE SIZE
CORNER uses the portion of the input image defined by the SIZE
parameter, minus any border specified by the BORDER  parameter.  
If the SIZE field is not entered, the image size is obtained from the
VICAR label.
.VARIABLE WIDTH
The WIDTH parameter determines the size of the interval over which the
gradient and second derivative are computed.  The larger the WIDTH parameter,
the less the program pays attention to noise and fine detail.  CORNER ignores
most features that have a diameter much less than the WIDTH parameter.
In the initial search for edge pixels, CORNER looks through a line for a pixel
for which the average brightness of the preceding M pixels differs from 
the average brightness of the succeeding M pixels by at least the GTHRESH
value, where M is the WIDTH value.  The default value for WIDTH is 4.
.VARIABLE GTHRESH
The GTHRESH parameter is used roughly as a gradient magnitude threshold for
edge detection.  If GTHRESH is defaulted, the program automatically computes a
threshold based on the brightness variation in the image. 
In the initial search for edge pixels, CORNER looks through a line for a pixel
for which the average brightness of the preceding M pixels differs from 
the average brightness of the succeeding M pixels by at least the GTHRESH
value, where M is the WIDTH value.  

This parameter can have a major effect on the number of corner locations
found.  For images with very low contrast, it may be more reliable to
explicitly specify a small value for GTHRESH, such as 5.
.VARIABLE NAH
CORNER divides the input image into NAV rows (and NAH columns) of rectangular
cells.  For each rectangular cell, CORNER finds the corner of greatest quality.
The default for NAH is 5.
.VARIABLE NAV
CORNER divides the input image into NAV rows (and NAH columns) of rectangular
cells.  For each rectangular cell, CORNER finds the corner of greatest quality.
The default for NAV is 5.
.VARIABLE THRESH
In some applications, only non-zero pixels are considered to be image data.
In such cases, the default value of 1 for THRESH can be used.  CORNER considers
any pixel with a DN less than THRESH to not be image data.  This parameter is
used so that the edge of image data will be ignored during the corner search.
Use THRESH=0 if 0 is to be included as image data.  (Negative halfword values
are always considered to not be image data by CORNER.)
.VARIABLE BORDER
CORNER uses the portion of the input image defined by the SIZE
parameter, minus any border specified by the BORDER  parameter.  
All corner locations found will be more than the BORDER value of pixels 
from the edge of the image so that these locations can be used for 
FFT correlation by another program.  
.VARIABLE PRINT
The default is for CORNER
 to print a list of corner locations found.
'NOPRINT supresses printed output.
