VICAR program REMRAY

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Remray removes small artifacts such as cosmic ray or high energy charged 
particle tracks from images. The artifacts are always assumed to be brighter 
than the true image intensities.
Remray can remove small clusters of pixels which Remnoise cannot handle.

EXECUTION:
median inp=image out=median nlw=5 nsw=5
remray inp=(image,median) out=smooth tol=20

METHOD:
An input image has dn values of DN.
A model for the background is taken from the median image.
An activity measure is computed from the medians as the absolute value of
a derivative filter whose kernel is
-1 -1 -1
-1  8 -1
-1 -1 -1 
If DN-median exceeds GAIN1*(the median) + GAIN2*(the activity)
the pixel is reset to the median average over a 3 by 3 area..

The algorithm is as follows for each pixel:
1. Select a 3 by 3 window of DN(i,j).
2. Subtract the median window MED(i,j)
   HP(i,j)=DN(i,j)-MED(i,j)
3. Compute an activity measure A from:
the absolute value of a derivative filter whose kernel is
-1 -1 -1
-1  8 -1
-1 -1 -1 
6. If(HP(2,2) > GAIN1*MED(2,2) + GAIN2*A) then 
    DN(2,2)= the 3 by 3 median average.
   ( the (2,2) refers to the central pixel in the 3 by 3 window).

If the GAIN1 and GAIN2 factors are defaulted they are computed from TOL. To do
this remray computes histograms of the median intensity and the activity and
selects the upper few percent values. Then..
GAIN1=TOL/(max dn of medians)
GAIN2=TOL/(max activity of medians).

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
1. Input image.
2. Median image
   nlw=nsw=3 or
   nlw=nsw=5 or
   whatever works. 

.VARI OUT
output image.

.VARI TOL
Tolerance threshold.

.VARI GAIN1
Intensity gain factor.
(default is to compute
it from TOL.)

.VARI GAIN2
Activity gain factor.
(default is to compute
it from TOL.)

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
1. Input image.
2. Median image generated with a 3 by 3 or a 5 by 5 filter.
   The filter size should exceed the artifact size by a factor of 2.

.VARI OUT
output image with artifacts removed.

.VARI TOL
Tolerance threshold. Defaults to 20.
Used to automatically set the GAIN1 and GAIN2 keywords if they are not 
specified.

.VARI GAIN1
Intensity gain factor. 
Used to compute a threshold proportional to the local median.
The default is to compute it from TOL and the maximum dn in the image:
GAIN1=TOL/(max dn of medians)
Pixels are changed if their median values exceed  a total 
threshold composed of
GAIN1*median + GAIN2*activity.

.VARI GAIN2
Activity gain factor.
Used to compute a threshold proportional to the unevenness of the local scene.
The default is to compute it from TOL and the maximum activity in the image:
GAIN2=TOL/(max activity of medians).
Activity is the absolute value of a derivative filter:
-1 -1 -1
-1  8 -1
-1 -1 -1
Pixels are changed if their median values exceed  a total 
threshold composed of
GAIN1*median + GAIN2*activity.
