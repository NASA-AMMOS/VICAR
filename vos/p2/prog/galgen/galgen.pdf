VICAR Program GALGEN
.HELP
PURPOSE:
   GALGEN is a VICAR applications program used to generate radiometric
calibration (slope) and dark current files.  These files are used to radiome-
trically correct flight images via the program GALSOS (Galileo) or DECAL 
(Cassini).  The program also generates files containing statistical data 
measuring the linearity at each pixel.  These latter files may be input 
to the program BLEMGEN to generate camera blemish files.

   GALGEN was originally specific to the Galileo SSI camera.  It will also
work for the Cassini ISS camera.  The program assumes a linear light-transfer 
curve.  See also GLLPFCF.

EXECUTION STATEMENT:

  GALGEN INP=(D1,D2,D3,...,Dn) OUT=(CAL,SAT,ERR,RMS,DC) DC=DC EDC=EDC +
         <user-params>

     or

  GALGEN INP=D1 LIST=LT.LIST OUT=(CAL,SAT,ERR,RMS,DC) DC=DC EDC=EDC +
         <user-params>



  The input frames D1,D2,D3,...,Dn should comprise a light-transfer sequence,
consisting of not more than 10 images of a featureless, uniformly 
illuminated target (flat-field frames) in order of increasing exposure.  
Their filenames may be input to the program in the form of a SRCH-format 
text file (see program SRCH).  If extended-exposure frames are included 
in the sequence (Galileo), an extended-dark-current frame (EDC) must be 
specified.  If multiple frames are taken at any given exposure, they may 
be summed via program PICSUM and the resulting summed frame input to GALGEN.  
The inputs may be in byte or 16-bit integer format.

  The output files (CAL,SAT,ERR,RMS,DC) are images in the same format as the
input flat-field frames (400x400 or 800x800 for Galileo, 256x256, 512x512, or
1024x1024 for Cassini):

  CAL is the output radiometric slope file (REAL*4),
  SAT is an output file identifying the low-full-well pixels (16-bit data),
  ERR is an output file containing the maximum absolute difference (in DN)
       between the input data samples and the fitted curve (16-bit data),
  RMS is an output file containing the rms error for the fit (16-bit data),
  DC is the output dark-current file (linear model only, 16-bit data).

.page
OPERATION:
  GALGEN assumes a linear model of the light-transfer function.  For a
given line-sample coordinate (i,j), the light-transfer function is of the
form:
	d(i,j) = c(i,j)e(i) + dc(i,j)		(1)

where e(i) is the exposure at image line i, d(i,j) is the output camera
signal (DN), and c(i,j) and dc(i,j) are the slope and offset (dark-current)
terms.

  GALGEN assumes that the intensity of the light source is held constant
and that the exposure is varied by varying the shutter speed of the camera.
The exposure e(i) is computed from the light of the light cannon, the commanded
shutter time t, and the shutter offset to(i):

	e(i) = l*[t - to(i)]			(2)

  For Galileo, the light of the light cannon must be specified via the LIGHT
parameter, the camera gain state must be specified via the GAIN parameter, and
the commanded exposure times (in msec) for input frames D1,D2,D3,...,Dn must be
specified via the EXPOSURE parameter.  Alternatively, the shutter settings may
be input via the SHUTTER parameter.  The Shutter-Offset File is specified via
the OFFSET parameter.  

  For Cassini, specifying LIGHT, GAIN, and EXPOSURE is optional (the parameter
SHUTTER is not used for Cassini).  The values are extracted from the VICAR
label if the parameters are not given.

  To determine whether LIGHT is in relative foot-lamberts or picoamps,
sr/nanometer, UNITS is used.  If UNITS=LUMINANC, LIGHT is in relative
foot-lamberts).  If UNITS=RADIANCE, LIGHT is in picoamps.
(UNITS should be LUMINANC for Galileo and RADIANCE for Cassini).

  GALGEN operates in two modes.  In the default mode (FIT=LINEAR), GALGEN
solves for both the slope and offset terms at each pixel position in the
image by fitting a straight line (via least squares) through the input
data points (extracted from input files (D1,D2,D3,...).  The inverse of the
slope (1/c) is output to the radiometric slope file (CAL) and the offset is 
output to DC.  If FIT=SLOPE is specified, then GALGEN solves for the 
slope-term only by fitting the input points to the function:

	d(i,j) = c(i,j)e(i) - do(i,j)		(3)

where do(i,j) is extracted from the input dark-current file (DC).  The inverse
of the slope (1/c) is output to CAL and no DC file is output.

  If the input frames have been pre-processed by PICSUM to sum multiple
frames, GALGEN will normalize the data by dividing by the picture scale
(extracted from the picture label) prior to performing the fit.  The picture
scale may be optionally input via the NUMB parameter.

  For pixels with unsuccessful fits, the CAL file will receive a 0.0, the
SAT, ERR, and RMS files will receive -1.0 and the DC file will receive 0.

While processing each pixel, if a saturated level is detected, that level
and all higher levels are ignored.  This saturation value is 255 for Galileo
and 4095 for Cassini.

.page
Notes:
For Slope model, the DC parameter is not required.  The dark-current file
can be in the input list as the first frame.  This model will subtract
the first input file from all the others before performing fit.  However,
it assumes that this first file is a true dark-current, this Slope model should
yield slope values which go thru the origin.

For Linear model, all input files are fitted without adjustment.  A fifth
output file is produced which is the best fit offsets associated with the
output slope values.

.page
PROGRAM FLOW
  The processing GALGEN performs can be broken into three distinct
modules which are processed sequentially.  First all the input and output
files are opened and prepared for use.  Any input file errors will be
flagged at this point.  Second, the program parameters will be examined
and verified with the input files as necessary.  Finally, all specified
output calibration files will be generated simultaneously line by line.
As processing progresses, informational messages will be given to keep
the user apprised of the current processing.

  If there is a program or system failure, it will not be possible to
recover from a mid-point in the file processing.

.page
EXTENDED-EXPOSURE DARK-CURRENT CORRECTION FOR GALILEO:
  If extended-exposure mode frames are included in the light-transfer
sequence, the EXTEXPO parameter must be used to specify the exposure
at which the extended-exposure data begins, and an extended-exposure
dark-current file (EDC) must be specified.  An adjustment is made to
correct for the difference in dark-current level between extended-exposure
mode frames and frames taken at the normal exposures.  If SLOPE is
specified, this adjustment consists of replacing the normal exposure
dark-current (DC) by the extended-exposure dark-current in equation 3.
If LINEAR is specified (the default), the extended-exposure dark-current
is subtracted from all extended-exposure data and the normal dark-current
is added.

  Sequences which consist entirely of extended-exposure mode data could
be processed like normal exposure data.  I.e., the extended-exposure
dark-current should be specified in the DC parameter; the EXTEXPO parameter
should not be used.

LOW-FULL-WELL-PIXEL TEST:
  The keyword LFWPT enables the low-full-well-pixel test for automatically
scanning for low-full-well pixels by checking for non-linearities in the
input data points (see LFWPT, SKIP, and ERROR parameters).  The SAT file
contains the DN at full-well for each LFW pixel and 32767 for all good
pixels.

.page
RESTRICTIONS:

1.  A maximum of 10 exposure levels (not counting the optiona DC) are
    allowed.


EXAMPLE:

If multiple frames are acquired at each exposure, they may be combined via
program PICSUM and the resulting summed frames input to GALGEN:

   PICSUM (DC1,DC2,DC3,DC4,DC5) DC	     !Sum dark-current frames
   PICSUM (A1,A2,A3,A4,A5) A		     !Sum frames at exposure 133.22
   PICSUM (B1,B2,B3,B4,B5) B		     !Sum frames at exposure 200.0
   PICSUM (C1,C2,C3,C4) C		     !Sum frames at exposure 266.67
   PICSUM (D1,D2,D3) D			     !Sum frames at exposure 400.0
   PICSUM (E1,E2) E			     !Sum frames at exposure 533.33
   PICSUM (EDC1,EDC2,EDC3) EDC		     !Sum extended-dark-current frames
					     !Input summed dark-current,

   GALGEN INP=(A,B,C,D,E) + 		     !Exposures
     OUT=(CAL.GRN,SAT,ERR,RMS,DC.GRN) +	     !Output files
     DC=DC EDC=EDC			     |Dark-current files
     EXPO=(133.22,200,266.67,400,533.33) +   !Commanded exposure times (in msec)
     EXTEXPO=5 LIGHT=3.54 +
     GAIN=100 +
     ERROR=(0,20) SKIP=4 +
     OFFSETS=OFFSETS.DAT

NOTE:  The frames must be input in order of ascending exposure.  The
exposures, specified by the EXPO parameter, must be given in the same order
(It is not necessary to specify the exposure for DC or EDC).  EXTEXPO=5
specifies that the 5th exposure above the dark-current (533.33 msec) is the
beginning of the extended-exposure data.  All data is in the 100K gain-state.

 Inputs are flat-field images in order of increasing exposure.  If multiple
 frames are acquired at a given exposure, these frames may be combined
 via PICSUM.
.VARIABLE OUT
 STRING--REQUIRED
	OUT=(CAL,SAT,ERR,RMS,DC)
 The output files (CAL,SAT,ERR,RMS,DC) are images in the same format as the
 input flat-field frames (400x400 or 800x800 for Galileo, 256x256, 512x512, or
 1024x1024 for Cassini):).  If the keyword  LINEAR is specified (the default),
 all five outputs are required.  If SLOPE  is specified, then DC should not be
 specified, and SAT, ERR, and RMS are optional.

 CAL is the Radiometric File, and contains the inverse slope term of the
 light-transfer function for each pixel position (i,j).  The elements of CAL
 are REAL*4 values z(i,j) such that:
	z(i,j) = SCALE/c  for normal pixels (inverse slope term)
	       = 0.0   for an unsuccessful fit.	
 
 SAT contains the saturation DN value (DNfw) for each low-full-well pixel.
 The elements of SAT are 16-bit integers s(i,j) such that:

	       = DNfw   for low-full-well pixels
	       = -1     for an unsuccessful fit.
 
 ERR contains the maximum absolute deviation (Emax) of the input pixels
 from the fitted light-transfer curve.  The elements of ERR are 16-bit
 integers f(i,j) such that:
	f(i,j) = -1           for an unsuccessful fit
	       = Emax*FSCALE  otherwise.

 of RMS are 16-bit integers r(i,j) such that:
	r(i,j) = -1           for an unsuccessful fit
	       = Erms*FSCALE  otherwise.
 where FSCALE is specified by the FITSCALE parameter (default=1.0).

 If the keyword LINEAR is specified, the output Dark-Current File (DC)
 contains the offset terms (Do) resulting from the fit.  The elements of DC
 are 16-bit integers d(i,j) such that:
	d(i,j) = 0  for an unsuccessful fit
	       = 128*Do  otherwise.
.VARIABLE DC
 STRING--OPTIONAL
 Specifies the input Dark-current file.  This parameter is required when the
 parameter FIT is equal to SLOPE.
.VARIABLE EDC
 STRING--OPTIONAL
 Specifies the input extended Dark-current file.  This paremter is required
 when extened exposure flat fields are used in conjuntion with normal exposure
 flat fields as input.
 NOTE:  The parameters DC & EXTEXP must also be specified.
.VARIABLE GAIN
 INTEGER--REQUIRED for Galileo
 Specifies camera gain state.  Valid values are 10, 40, 100, 400 for Galileo,
 40, 100, 400, 1400 for Cassini.  This parameter must be given for Galileo, but
 if not given for Cassini is extracted from the VICAR label.
.VARIABLE UNITS
 Specifies whether LIGHT is in LUMINANC (Relative-foot-Lamberts ) or RADIANCE
 (nanowatts/cm**2/sr/nanometer).  UNITS should be LUMINANC for Galileo and
 RADIANCE for Cassini).
.VARIABLE LIGHT
 REAL-REQUIRED for Galileo
 LIGHT gives the light cannon setting (in foot-lamberts or nanowatts/cm**2/sr/
 nanometer) at which the flat  field images were exposed (assumed to be
 constant throughout the sequence).  This parameter must be given for Galileo,
 but if not given for Cassini is extracted from the VICAR label.
.VARIABLE EXPOSURE
 REAL--OPTIONAL
 Specifies the commanded exposure times (in milliseconds) for each input
 frame in the light-transfer sequence.  The exposures must be input either
 via the EXPOSURE or SHUTTER parameter (see below).  Not needed for the
 DC or EDC input frames.  EXPOSURE or SHUTTER  must be given for Galileo, but
 if not given for Cassini is extracted from the VICAR label.
.VARIABLE SHUTTER
 INTEGER--OPTIONAL
 This parameter is for Galileo only.   Gives the shutter setting for each flat
 field input image.  The shutter setting is related to commanded exposure time
 as follows:

       Shutter          Exposure     | Shutter           Exposure
       Setting          time (ms)    | Setting           time (ms)

.VARIABLE NUMB
 INTEGER--OPTIONAL
 Specifies the picture scale for each input frame.
     E.g. NUMB=([Ndc,]N1,N2,N3,...,Nn[,Nedc])
 If an input frame Di represents multiple frames that have been combined via
 PICSUM, then Ni should equal the number of frames added together (=1 for
 single frames).  When either a dark-current (DC) or an extended-dark-current
 frame (EDC) are specified, then the picture scales: "Ndc" and "Nedc" should
 be included, as needed.  If NUMB is defaulted, the picture scale is retrieved
 from the image labels.
.VARIABLE EXTEXPO
 INTEGER--OPTIONAL - GALILEO only
 EXTEXPO specifies the exposure at which the extended-dark-current
 correction is to be applied.
    galgen (D1,D2,D3,D4,D5,D6,D7) CAL DC=DC EDC=EDC EXTEXPO=5
 The correction will be applied here to frames D5, D6, and D7.
 NOTE:  The parameters DC & EDC must also be specified.
.VARIABLE SCALE
 REAL--OPTIONAL--Default=1.0
 SCALE specifies scaling of the output slope terms.  Instead of outputing
 1/c in the slope file, SCALE/C is output.
.VARIABLE FIT
 KEYWORD--OPTIONAL--Default=LINEAR
 FIT specifies whether, while fitting the input data points to the light-
 transfer curve, to solve for the slope term only (FIT=SLOPE) or to solve
 for both the slope and offset terms (FIT=LINEAR).

 If FIT=LINEAR is specified, the input data points D1,D2,D3,...,Dn are
 fitted to the curve:
		Di = C*Ei + DC
 where the exposures Ei are computed from the commanded exposure times,
 light-cannon setting, and shutter-offsets (see EXPOSURE, SHUTTER, LUMINANC, and
 OFFSET parameters).  The inverses of the resulting slopes (1/C) are output
 to the Radiometric File (CAL).  The resulting offsets are output to the
 output dark-current file (DC).  Even though the input DC frame is not used
 in any calculations, it still must be included as the last input frame.

 If FIT=SLOPE is specified, the input data points D1,D2,D3,...,Dn are fitted
 to the curve:
		Di = C*Ei + DC
 and DC is the input dark-current extracted from the DC parameter.
 The inverses of the resulting slopes (1/C) are output to the Radiometric File
 (CAL).
.VARIABLE FITSCALE
 REAL--OPTIONAL--Default=1.0
 Specifies a number (FSCALE) used to scale the maximum residual error (ERR)
 and rms error (RMS) resulting from the least squares fit.  See OUT parameter
 for details.
.VARIABLE LFWPT
 KEYWORD--OPTIONAL
 The keyword LFWPT enables the low-full-well-pixel test for automatically
 scanning for low-full-well pixels by checking for non-linearities in the
 input data points.  Starting with the first n data points (where n is
 specified via the SKIP parameter), the points are iteratively included
 in the fit.  The next point (not yet included) is checked to see if it
 falls more than a certain distance (determined from the ERROR parameter)
 below the fitted curve (in units of DN).  If a point is rejected, then
 all points above this level are also thrown out, and the raw dn of the last
 pixel used in the fit is placed into the SAT file as a record of the
 saturated DN level (low-full-well for the CCD).

 If the keyword LFWPT is not specified, then the test is suppressed, and
 the positions of the low-full-well pixels are retrieved from tables built
 into the program.
.VARIABLE SKIP
 INTEGER--OPTIONAL--Default=4
 Specifies number of exposures at low end to skip before applying the low
 full well pixel test.  See LFWPT for details.
.VARIABLE ERROR
 REAL--OPTIONAL-Default=(.05,1.)
      ERROR=(delta1,delta2)
 The ERROR parameter specifies the error threshold EPS (in DN) as a linear
 function of the exposure e (in relative-foot-Lambert-msec or picoamp-msec):
      EPS = delta1*e + delta2
 The error threshold is applied in the low-full-well-pixel test (see
 parameter LFWPT).
.VARIABLE OFFSETS
 STRING--REQUIRED
 Specifies the Shutter-Offset File.  The file is generated by program
 CCDRECIP.
.VARIABLE LIST
 STRING--OPTIONAL
 Specifies the name of the SRCH-format text file containing the names of
 the input files to be processed.  This is an alternative to listing the 
 filenames on the command line with the INP parameter.  

 Inputs are flat-field images in order of increasing exposure.  If multiple
 frames are acquired at a given exposure, these frames may be combined
 via PICSUM.
