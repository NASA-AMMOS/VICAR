VICAR program disparity

.HELP
Disparity combines two disparity images (line and sample disparity images)
into a single image representing radial disparity. The input images come 
from a pair of microscope images which are at the same camera location but
at different focus positions.
Restriction: The disparity must be radially outward, not inward.

EXAMPLE:

I used marscor3.  It wants an input disparity map.  Easiest thing to do is
to give it an identity map at really reduced resolution.

I used a 64x64 map.  That equates to a pyramid level of 4 (128,256,512,1024
is 4 steps).  Use gen to make it.  From memory (not tried):

$R2LIB/gen fake.line 64 64 linc=1 sinc=0 ival=1 -real
$R2LIB/gen fake.samp 64 64 linc=0 sinc=1 ival=1 -real
$R2LIB/viccub \(fake.line fake.samp\) fake.disp

$MARSLIB/marscor3 inp=\( img1 img2 \) out=out.disp in_disp=fake.disp
  templ=\(13,13\) search=29 q=.25 -gore gore_q=.25 gore_pass=4
  disp_pyramid=4 -amoeba8 ftol=.002 -multipass

copy inp=out.disp out=linedisp sb=1 nb=1
copy inp=out.disp out=sampdisp sb=2 nb=1
disparity inp=(linedisp,sampdisp) out=dtm bounds=(-2.,2.)

dtm is a REAL format file.

METHOD:
Two images obtained at different focus locations display radial disparity.
This program converts line & sample disparity into radial disparity.
It also removes the overall average radial motion in order to reveal the
differential radial disparity which betrays topography.
Any differential disparity which exceeds BOUNDS is interpolated over. This
includes non correlated points and bad correlations.
