VICAR Program avgpix - computes average of input set of images

.help
PURPOSE:

    AVGPIX reads a list of VICAR byte image filenames and calculates their average
    DN. Zero-valued pixels are excluded from the averaging. The output is written
    as a single byte image.

EXECUTION:

    avgpix INP=(A) OUT=(B) LIST=(C)
     
    A is an image used to generate the output file label. It should be included
      in the input list file.
    B is the output VICAR byte image.
    C is a path to a text file of input image names to average.
