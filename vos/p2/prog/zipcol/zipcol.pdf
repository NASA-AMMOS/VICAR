PURPOSE

	ZIPCOL is used to enter data into an existing IBIS interface file.
Data can be transferred to the interface file from another interface file,
data cards, or both sources. Data is entered by matching keys between the
interface file and the data sources. Pre-sorting of the interface file and
the data sources is required. The size of the interface file is not changed
by operation of ZIPCOL.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

	zipcol INP=(A,B) INCOL=(X1,X2,X3,...XK) OUTCOL=(Y1,Y2,Y3,...YK)
		NULL=(C1,C2,...CN) FILE=(D1,D2,D3,...DK,E1,E2,...EN)

	Where A is the IBIS interface file being modified and B is a
secondary input interface file.

EXAMPLE

	zipcol INP=(INT1,INT2) INCOL=(28,27) OUTCOL=(1,2,3,4)
		FILE=(6,7,8,9,10,11) NULL=(0,0,0,0)

	In this example, columns 6, 7, from INT2 will be used to match
columns 28, 27 from INT1. If a match is made to columns 6,7 of INT2,
then columns 8, 9, 10, 11 from INT2 will be placed in columns 1, 2, 3, 4
of INT1. If no match is found zeros will be placed in columns 1, 2, 3, 4
of INT1.

.PAGE
OPERATION

	ZIPCOL operation is as follows. Each key in the first file is checked
against each key in the second. If a match is found, data is transferred from
the second file to the first file. Resultant information is written in an
update mode to the interface file being modified.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
1. The IBIS interface file
     being modified.
2. The secondary input
     interface file.
.VARIABLE INCOL
Matching columns in first file
.VARIABLE OUTCOL
Columns in first file to 
receive data from second
.VARIABLE NULL
Values to use in no match
.VARIABLE NULSTR
NULL for alphas
.VARIABLE FILE
Matching and data columns
in second interface file
.VARIABLE MODE
'ALPHA for matching on
alphanumeric string data

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP number 1 is the IBIS interface file being modified.
INP number 2 is the secondary input interface file.
.VARIABLE INCOL
INCOL is used to specify columns in INP number 1, which are used as matching
keys. These keys are in columns X1 to Xk.
.VARIABLE OUTCOL
OUTCOL is used to specify columns Y1 to Yn of INT1 which will recieve data
when INCOL matches are found.
.VARIABLE NULL
NULL is used to specify what operation will take place if no match is found
for any keys in INP number 1. If NULL is not specified, the data in columns
Y1 to Yn remain unchanged if a match does not occur. If NULL is specified,
then values C1 to Cn are to be used as data values if no match is found. 
.VARIABLE NULSTR
 Same as NULL, used to input a 4 character string.
.VARIABLE FILE
Columns D1 toDk are the matching keys in the secondary input file. Column
numbers E1 to En specify the columns where data to be transferred to the
OUTCOL columns in INP number 1 are found. The number of 'D' values and 'E'
values must correspond to the number of values following INCOL and OUTCOL
respectively.
.VARIABLE MODE
Use the keyword 'ALPHA if the matching columns contain alphanumeric 
string data rather than real values.  The files must have been sorted
alphabetically with SORT.
