.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "comprs"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   This program creates a compressed output file by compressing
the input file.  The compression type can by specified by specifying
COMPRESS="NONE", COMPRESS="BASIC", or COMPRESS="BASIC2".  By
specifying COMPRESS="NONE", it will create an uncompressed output
file.  Compression type BASIC and BASIC2 are similar in algorithm
and they only differ in the way the compressed indices are placed
inside the compressed file.  NOTE: The user does not have to be
concerned with the input compression type as this will be handled
by the VICAR rtl.

EXECUTION

   The program simply reads a line from the input file and 
writes it out to the output file using the compression type
specified.

EXAMPLES

   comprs inp=x1 out=x2 compress=BASIC

This command will compress x1 using BASIC compression method and
create a compressed file called x2.

   comprs inp=x1 out=x2 compress=NONE

This command will uncompress x1 (it does not matter if x1 is
compressed or not as we are only concerned with the output
file) and create a file x2.

RESTRICTIONS

The size of image cannot be greater than 
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes.  64 bit long integer is
used to keep track of EOL label position.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
 Input image file
.VARIABLE OUT
 Output image file
.VARIABLE COMPRESS
 Compression type

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 Input image file.  May be compressed or not as you wish, the RTL automatically
 detects and deals with it.

.VARIABLE OUT
 Output image file.  Will be compressed or not based on the COMPRESS parameter.

.VARIABLE COMPRESS 

 This variable specifies the output compression
 type.  The valid choices are NONE (uncompressed)
 BASIC and BASIC2.
