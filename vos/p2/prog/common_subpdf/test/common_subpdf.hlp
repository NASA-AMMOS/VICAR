COMMON_SUBPDF.COM - help information

This COM-file was developed in order to provide various sub-PDF's which can
be used by Menu-driven PDF's (i.e. so-called MDF's). The sub-PDF's included
in COMMON.COM are intended to be used commonly by different main Menus,
so they don't have to be included in these program's COM-files. Instead, they
will be included in P2$LIB (UNIX: $P2LIB) so they can be used by everybody.
The programmer has to use their names in his MDF to invoke the entry points
for the sub-PDF's and he/she has to specify all parameters used in the
sub-PDF's in his/her main PDF (which has to be associated with each
Menu-driven PDF).

Currently, only two sub-PDF's which could be of general interest are contained
in COMMON.COM:

COMMON_SAVE_PAR.PDF	-	This sub-PDF specifies an entry point in
				Menu where the user can specify a name for
				the TAE-parameter file which is generated by the
				program (the default name in VICAR programs:
				LAST.PAR). This is useful because in a Menu
				there is no 'save'-command to save a para-
				meter file with a user-specified name (e.g.
				"save proc_name.par").

COMMON_PROC_DONE	-	This sub-PDF is the entry point which is
				selected to execute the program.
