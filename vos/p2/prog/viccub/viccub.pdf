PURPOSE

WRITTEN BY Thomas Roatsch, DLR    9-Apr-1997

VICCUB copies input images into 1 multi-band image.

All images must have the same size and the same format.
The maximum number of input images is 255.

If the BAND parameter is given, the selected band is read
from each input.  If there are not enoungh BAND parameters,
1 is assumed for the extras.  If a given band is higher than
the number of bands in the input image, the highest available
band is used.  Thus a "colorglyph" could be made from two
color stereo files like this:

$R2LIB/viccub \( l r r \) cg band=\(1 2 3\)

The "highest available" property means that the same command
could be used with single-band images to make an anaglyph.
