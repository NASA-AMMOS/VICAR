!  This is the original EDIMAGE test script, written by Frank Evans.
!  It contains a number of interactive steps, which make it unsuitable for
!  the standard I&T test procedures.  Therefore a stripped-down version of
!  it, tstedimage1.scr, was created for use in tstedimage.pdf.
!  This version is retained for completeness.  (LWK - Mar.2010)
