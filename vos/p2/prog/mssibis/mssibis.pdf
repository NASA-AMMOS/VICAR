PURPOSE

    "mssibis" transfers data between MSS format images and IBIS tabular file.
    Data may be transfered to IBIS files from Vicar images using a mask image.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
1.  Input dataset (MSS format 
  image or IBIS tabular file)
2.  Optional mask image
  for 'TOIBIS mode.
.VARIABLE OUT
Output dataset (IBIS tabular
file or MSS format image)
.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard VICAR size field.
Refers to one band in MSS
format image.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
Not used in 'TOMSS.
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
Not used in 'TOMSS.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples in one band
.VARIABLE MODE     
Keyword for direction
('TOIBIS or 'TOMSS)
.VARIABLE MSS
Number of bands in MSS
format dataset.
.VARIABLE BANDS
Which bands to use in
MSS format image.
.VARIABLE COLS
Columns for data in
IBIS file.
.VARIABLE NCOL     
Number of columns in 
output IBIS file.
.VARIABLE INC      
The increment (or subsampling)
factor for 'TOIBIS mode.
.VARIABLE FORMAT   
The pixel format for the 
output MSS format image.
.VARIABLE UPDATE
Indicates the OUT file is an
old file to 'UPDATE.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
    In 'TOIBIS mode the first input file is a Vicar MSS format image.  
The MSS format is a way of storing multiple bands of images in one Vicar 
image.  The multiple images are appended in the sample direction using
the Vicar program MSS.  A normal Vicar image can also be transfered as a
single banded MSS image.    
    The second input file is an optional mask image.  Only those pixels 
that are non zero in the mask image will be transfered.  The mask image 
should be the same size as one band in the MSS image.

    In 'TOMSS mode the input file is an IBIS tabular (interface) file.

.VARIABLE OUT
    In 'TOIBIS mode the output file is an IBIS tabular file.  The pixels
are put into the IBIS file in the order in which they are encountered,
i.e. from top to bottom and left to right.  Pixel values from the
specified bands are converted to real format and put in the specified
column of the tabular file.
 
    In 'TOMSS mode the output file in a MSS format Vicar image.  The
pixels are put into the MSS format image in the line scanning direction.
The pixels are rounded and clipped if necessary, depending on output pixel
format.  Each column corresponds to a separate MSS band.  The image size
(if not set by SIZE, NL or NS) will default to the largest square image
that may be completely filled by the column data.

.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard VICAR size field.   
Refers to one band in MSS format image.  Thus a subwindow from each band
will be taken out in 'TOIBIS mode. 
In 'TOMSS mode only the NL and NS part are used.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line.  Not used in 'TOMSS.
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample in one MSS band.  Not used in 'TOMSS.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines.
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples in one MSS band.
.VARIABLE MODE     
Keyword for transfer direction.  The default 'TOIBIS mode transfers data
from MSS format Vicar images to IBIS tabular files, while 'TOMSS mode
transfers data from tabular files to MSS format images.  The transfer
is always between columns and corresponding MSS bands.
.VARIABLE MSS
Number of bands in MSS format dataset.  Must include total number of
bands that make up the MSS format image, not only those that will be used.
.VARIABLE BANDS
Which bands to use in MSS format image.  Default is to use (1,2,...).
.VARIABLE COLS
Columns for data in IBIS file.  Default is to use (1,2,...). Each column
corresponds to a separate band in the MSS file.
.VARIABLE NCOL     
Number of columns in output IBIS file.  Only used in 'TOIBIS mode.
Only necessary if more columns are desired in the tabular file.
.VARIABLE INC      
The increment (or subsampling) factor for 'TOIBIS mode.  This is used
to decrease the amount of data transfered to the tabular file when only
a statistical sampling is desired.
.VARIABLE FORMAT   
The pixel format for the output MSS format image.  May be byte, half, full,
or real.  Only used for 'TOMSS mode.
