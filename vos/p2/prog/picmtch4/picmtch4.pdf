PURPOSE

     "picmtch4"  is a batch oriented image correlation routine 
     which incorporates the following features.

     1. Correlation  of  image  to image.

     2. Sampling  of one image to match the geometry of  the 
        other  image (e.g.  one image could be at  different 
        scale or rotation).

     3. Regular or phase correlation in the FFT domain.
.PAGE
     4. Specification of a magnification factor to correlate 
        a larger area without increasing computation.

     5. Use  of  a geometric model to estimate the  matching 
        locations  and  feedback of matches  to  refine  the 
        geometric model.

     6. Matching of images along a polygonal contour.

     7. Use  of  standard  data formats for  all  input  and 
        output data sets.

     8. Apodization is used for elimination of false peaks due
        to strong edge effects and for enhancement of subpixel
        matching.

     where

     A                   is the first image to be correlated.

     B                   is   the   second   image   to   be 
                         correlated.

     C                   is  an ibis file containing the points
                         to match in columns (1,2) and 9 more
                         empty columns.

     D                   is an output image containing visuals
                         of the matching areas.  


OPERATION

     First,  "picmtch4" sets up a geometric model relating the 
     two images using the ITIE-OTIE parameters.   The points 
     originally  given  are supplemented  by  matches  in the
     second image.   The  geometric  model is used to estimate  a 
     search  location  and to specify a  resampling  of  the 
     first  image to match the raster gridding of the second 
     image.   The model is a linear least squares fit to the 
     control  points.   For normal image to image  matching, 
     only  ITIE-OTIE  points  are  needed.   Their  accuracy 
     should be sufficient to yield a match within the search 
     area  specified  by parameters SEARCH and  MINSRCH  taking 
     into account nonlinearities in the data.
     
     If no ITIE-OTIE points are given, the program  will try
     to find GeoTIFF labels,  and will use them  to generate
     a  set of  ITIE-OTIE points  using the  labels and  the
     corners of the first image.
     
     For each point from the IBIS file taken in the first data
     set, the iteration over the correlation  point  set now 
     proceeds.   At the predicted point in the second input, 
     a FFTSIZxFFTSIZ sub-image is extracted. If the point is  a 
     fractional pixel location,  the center of extraction is 
     moved   to   align   with  pixel   spacing   to   avoid 
     interpolation.   In fact, interpolation will occur only 
     if  the keyword MAGNIFY is used with a nonintegral  value.  
     The  geometric  model  is used to  calculate  a  search 
     location in the first input.   If this is a  fractional 
     pixel  location,  then  it is also aligned  with  pixel 
     spacing  to minimize interpolation near the center.   A 
     sub-image is extracted of size WxW where W is somewhere 
     between  the values given by the parameters SEARCH  and 
     MINSRCH.  This  sub-image  is  extracted  by   bilinear 
     interpolation at a rotation and pixel size to match the 
     second  input  geometry as specified by  the  geometric 
     model discussed earlier.

     The FFTSIZxFFTSIZ pieces of the two inputs
     are each subjected to a complex valued DFT via the  FFT 
     algorithm.  One of the DFT arrays has its low frequency 
     terms  set  to  zero by zeroing the first row  and  the 
     first  column unless the parameter NOHPF is  specified.  
     Then  the DFT's are multiplied element by element  (one 
     DFT is  conjugated).  An  inverse  FFT  is  applied  to
     this  result and  the  peak  and  its  eight  neighbors 
     are saved.     The  subwindow is moved over  the search  
     area  with  an increment of at most  12  pixels.   When  
     the  entire search area is covered, the largest peak is 
     taken to be the correlation point. A final FFT correla-
     tion is performed at the correlation peak to get a refined 
     correlation.   Unless NOSUBPIX is specified a subpixel 
     match is  obtained by  fitting a quadratic  to the peak  
     and  its  eight neighbors. The match point is transformed 
     back to  the original image location  via  the  inverse  
     of   the geometric  model  and  incorporating  alignment  
     shifts performed in both images.  

     The results are written to the IBIS interface (tabular)
     file with one row for each tiepoint.  The following 
     column format is used:

     Column       Description			   Format

        1     First input line or East             real*4
        2     First input sample or North          real*4
        3     First input line                     real*4
        4     First input sample                   real*4
        5     First input z-value                  real*4
        6     Second input line                    real*4
        7     Second input sample                  real*4
	8     Second input z-value                 real*4
        9     Correlation value                    real*4
       10     line-residual                        real*4
       11     sample-residual                      real*4
       optional (must use ELVCOR keyword)
       12     line-elevation offset                real*4
       13     sample-elevation offset              real*4

    Information about each matching point is printed out unless 
    the NOPRINT keyword is specified.   The printed information
    is as follows:

        1   SEQ			Sequence number
	2   SECOND LOCATION	Tiepoint location in second image
	3   ESTIMATED LOCATION	Estimated location in first image
	4   FIRST LOCATION	Matching location in first image
				    (from correlation search)
	5   CORREL		Correlation value (between 0 and 1)
	6   WIN			Current search window size
	7   RESID		Residual distance (between estimated 
				    location and correlation location)
	8   FN			Failure number

     If correlation  fails,  nulls are written into the ibis 
     file  and  a failure number is given  in  the  printout 
     under the column heading FN.  The failure numbers are:

              1             point on edge of second image 
				(more than zerolim percent of chip off image)
              2             failure of RETRY option to exceed threshold
              4             correlation peak unreliable
              5             subpixel correlation failure


     Points  completely outside of either image are ???.




PRECISION

Due to the iterative nature of the subroutine llsq, the programs results will
vary from machine to machine.  When prnt in llsq's test program was temporarily
changed to a write statement, it was observed that the resulting output varied
from machine to machine.  The following table will provide some idea of the
differential between machines.

                         can also be geographic if the first
                         image has a GeoTIFF label and the label
                         coordinate system is used (column 1
                         will be the East and column 2 will

                         other 9 columns are filled (see main
                         help).  The first two columns may

                         "chips".  NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED.
.VARIABLE ITIE
     ITIE=(X1,Y1,...,X3,Y3)   This  specifies three
                              control  points in  the  first
                              input    image   to    control 
                              matching search and resampling 
                              geometry.   Can be  omitted if 
                              both images have GeoTIFF labels
                              and  the  GeoTIFF  mapping  is
                              desired for a matching model.
.VARIABLE OTIE
     OTIE=(P1,Q1,...,P3,Q3)   This specifies the  correspon
                              ding  control  points  in  the 
                              second  image.   If the second 
                              input  is  a  ground   control 
                              point  file then these  values 
                              are  latitude longitude pairs.  
                              The number of values given  to 
                              OTIE  must be the same as  the 
                              number to ITIE. Can be  omitted if 
                              both images have GeoTIFF labels
                              and  the  GeoTIFF  mapping  is
                              desired for a matching model.
.VARIABLE MAGNIFY
     MAGNIFY=(RL,RS)          This  specifies that  sampling 
                              from  both images is magnified 
                              by  RL in  the  line direction
                              and RS  in  the samp direction
                              (default 1.0,1.0).    The grid 
                              is  always FFTSIZE^2  so  this 
                              increases the correlation area 
                              without increasing computation.
			      The magnification can be speci-
			      fied  separately  for line and 
			      sample directions.  If you use
			      these, you must specify both.
.VARIABLE MAGSHRK
     MAGSHRK="y"              This specifies that the MAGNIFY
                              parameter will shrink by .9 for
                              every good fitting point.  Also
                              only applies after fit to points
                              is  obtained.   When MAGMIN  is
                              reached, then the  shrink is no
                              longer applied.
.VARIABLE MAGMIN
     MAGMIN=(RL,RS)           This specifies the minimum vals
                              for  MAGNIFY  when  MAGSHRK  is
                              used.  When MAGMIN is  reached,
                              then  the  shrink is  no longer
                              applied.
.VARIABLE SEARCH
     SEARCH=S                 This specifies that the search 
                              area  in  the first  input  is 
                              initially  an SxS  square  re-
                              gion.   Allow  for uncertainty 
                              and  nonlinearity in the esti-
                              mation of matching location by 
                              ITIE,  OTIE and add 12 more to 
                              S for ineffectiveness of  cor-
                              relation near the window edge.  
                              S  must be less than or  equal 
                              to   128  which  is  also  the 
                              default.
.VARIABLE MINSRCH
     MINSRCH=T                This   specifies   that    the 
                              initial   search   S  can   be 
                              reduced    upon     successful 
                              matching to a minimum value of 
                              T.    Note   that   successful 
                              matches  refine  the image  to 
                              image geometric model allowing 
                              a  reduction in search with  a 
                              consequent     savings      of 
                              computation.     The   default 
                              value  is 50 and miminum value 
                              is 32.

.VARIABLE ZWIND
     ZWIND=W                  The program calculates and outputs
			      the  average brightness values 
			      at  the matching coordinates.  
			      The average is calculated using
			      a W by W window.  Default is 7.
.VARIABLE ZREJECT
     ZREJECT=Z            The average brightness is rejected 
			      by setting the output Z value to
			      -999 if if falls below this value
			      The default is 5.

.VARIABLE RETRY
     RETRY=(N,T,R)            This  instructs the program to 
                              attempt  more  tries  near   a 
                              location    if    a    certain 
                              correlation  threshold is  not 
                              achieved.   N is the number of 
                              tries  (1 to 5), with the first
			      try being the at the original point.
			      T is  the correlation threshold 
			      required to stop the retry at each  
			      point.  A failure number is 
 			      printed every time the threshold 
			      test fails.  If all retries for 
			      a point fail then nothing is 
			      written to the output files.
                              The  retry pattern is to  move 
                              to  the corners of a square 
			      i.e. to move to (+/-R, +/-R) from
			      the original point.

.VARIABLE NOPRINT
        'NOPRINT	      This specifies that the normal 
			      printout is to be suppressed.  
			      Error messages will still be
			      printed. 

.VARIABLE NOHPF
       'NOHPF                 This   specifies   that    the 
                              default  high  pass filter  in 
                              the correlation is to be  shut 
                              off.   The  high  pass  filter 
                              consists  of zeroing the  low-
                              order  row  and column of  the 
                              DFT matrices.

.VARIABLE NOSUBPIX
         'NOSUBPIX            This  specifies that  subpixel 
                              correlation   is  not  to   be 
                              calculated (see operation)

.VARIABLE REDO
The correlation that results from a bad estimation of position will
usually be not as good as one resulting from a good estimate.  This
parameter will recalculate the user-selected number of points over
again at the end of processing.  Usually, the predictor has optimized
by the end of processing, so the results will be better.
.VARIABLE PRED
"LINEAR" will use a 2-D linear fit to predict where a point in the 
first image will match in the second image.  "QUAD" will use a 2-D
quadratic fit, but only when enough points are available to solve
for the coefficients of the quadratic.  Three points are needed 
to solve for linear coefficients, and six are needed for quadratic.
If the images have a keystone offset, use quadratic.
.VARIABLE AUTOFIT    
The value of this parameter (n) tells the routine to use the first n
correlations to set the threshold.  It will be the value for which
1/2 of n are above threshold and 1/2 n are below.  No values are 
allowed into the fit until these n points determine the threshold.
Then the convergence is held for the next set of n points while the
fit is being refined.  This whole procedure is to prevent a misleading
fit on the first point from sending the whole fitting process in the
wrong direction.

The user provided fitmin will be ignored, it is set by the process 
just outlined.
.VARIABLE FFTHALF
0 = default, no retries when zerolim exceeded
1 = one retry at half size
2 = one retry at half size, another retry at quarter size

This allows correlating closer to the image edge.  The correlation
threshold is toughened so that the correlation must be at the 
automatic threshold instead of within .5 of it.
.VARIABLE ZEROLIM
Setting this to a value limits the number of zeros in either image
chip to that percentage of zeros.  For the first image, exceeding
this percentage will cause a message "point outside first image"
and the point will not be used (column 9 will have -9999).  For
the second image, which may be searched, the individual chips
are rejected with no comment.  If the second image is 50% zeros
a message "point outside second image" is given.  Parts of a chip
cut off by an image edge are treated as zeros.

The parameter ZEROLIM2 allows the second image value to
be set independantly.  If it is not used, then the default
value of -1 causes the ZEROLIM for the second image to be the
same as the first image.
.VARIABLE ELVCOR
See routine piclsqm2 for use of these parameters
.VARIABLE ANGOFF  
tilts initial match predictor by this angle in degrees.  Gives
better correlation if the tilt is accurate.  After the solved fit
for a match predictor, this angle will no longer be used or have 
any effect on results.
