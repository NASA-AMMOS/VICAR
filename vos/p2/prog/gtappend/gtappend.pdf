gtappend - combine images top to bottom, check GeoTIFF labels for position
.HELP
PURPOSE:
gtappend combines up to 48 datasets into a single dataset with append format.
This is equivalent to concatenating the input images in a top to bottom
fashion.  The program works like VICAR routine APPEND if there are no
GeoTIFF labels.  If there are, the GeoTIFF labels of the inputs are read
for any of several mistakes:

1.  any differences in mapping
2.  a difference in scale
3.  a difference in image rotation with respect to North
4.  an error of offset, the images must butt together geographically
    exactly as they are concatenated in the image sense.
    
If any of these errors occur, the program aborts with an appropriate
error message.

A correct GeoTIFF label is attached to the output (it will be a copy
of the first (topmost) input since its offset is (1,1) in the VICAR
pixel referencing system.

If a SIZE parameter is used, it applies to all of the input images.
The SIZE parameter is not allowed in GeoTIFF label cases.

EXECUTION:

Example

gtappend INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D  will put images A, B, and C top-to-bottom
to form D.

OPERATION:
gtappend combines datasets in the following manner:

First, the data sets are checked for GeoTIFF labels, and if they are
present, a number of conditions must be satisfied or the program
aborts:

	1.  any differences in mapping
2.  a difference in scale
3.  a difference in image rotation with respect to North
4.  an error of offset, the images must butt together geographically
    exactly as they are concatenated in the image sense.
5.  if the first image has a GeoTIFF label then all must have one

The first input is read and copied to output (modified by SIZE if given).
Then the second image is read and copying to the output continues.  If
any of the images have a different NS, or a different pixel size, the
program abortw with an error message.

The program uses dynamic allocation of buffers in the C programming
language, so truly colossal images can be combined (for example, an
output image of 30 x 10,000,000) would not be a problem.

 TIMING: 

As fast as VICAR can read and write the lines.

  2016-01-13 WLB - Replaced printfs with zifmessages
  2019-09-04 WLB - IDS-7922 - Initialized some variables.
  
.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input image files
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output image file
.VARIABLE SIZE
INTEGER - Region of input files
to be concatenated
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of samples
.VARIABLE TOLER
REAL - Error allowed in GeoTIFF
labels (unit is pixels)
.VARIABLE MAPCK
MAPCK - Will do GeoTIFF map
check (default)
NOMAPCK - Turns off GeoTIFF
map check
.VARIABLE OVERLAP1
Use if images overlap one
pixel, as in DMA DTED
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the input data sets.  Up to 48 are allowed.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The SIZE parameter may be used when only a sub-region of each image is to
be concatenated; it has the format SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS), where the parameters
are starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.  SIZE=(1,1,10,10), for example, will cause gtappend to only look
at the first ten samples of each of the first ten lines in each image, when
performing the concatenation. The default (1,1,0,0) means use the whole image.

The SIZE parameter is not allowed in GeoTIFF cases.
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of samples (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE TOLER
As each image is butted, the mappings are checked for whether they
continue smoothly across the seam.  The default tolerance of one
millionth of a pixel allows for a fair amount of numeric error in
the calculations, which should always be carried out in double
precision.

See the main help for other checks on the mapping (coordinate system,
projection, datum, rotation, scale, etc must all be the same).
.VARIABLE MAPCK
The default, MAPCK, will do GeoTIFF map checking (or do nothing if there
are no GeoTIFF labels).  Using the other option, NOMAPCK, is useful to
add extra pixels to the bottom of a GeoTIFF image, or to adjoin
an image that is already known to be mapped correctly but doesn't have
a GeoTIFF label.  The first, or top, image must have a correct
GeoTIFF label.
.VARIABLE OVERLAP1
Use if images overlap one pixel, as in DMA DTED.  

The program will strip one pixel between each image, from the topmost
image of each pair.  The extra pixel in the last image is NOT stripped.
So two 601 pixel images will concatenate into a 1201 pixel image.

If geotiff labels are present, the location checking will account for
the overlap pixel.  If the images do not, in fact, have an overlap and
this keyword is used, an error would be reported if the geotiff labels
were present, because there would be a missing pixel.

Bottom line for geotiff labels, if there is not a clean butt or an overlap
of one pixel, you have to use imcopy to cut one of the images or 
featherv to mosaic the images.
