! THE INPUT OF FFT1PIX IS THE OUTPUT OF FFT1.
! *** PLEASE NOTE THAT FFT1 IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON THE UNIX 
!     SYSTEM AND IS REQUIRED FOR THIS TEST SCRIPT.  ONCE FFT1 IS
!     AVAILABLE, THIS COMMENT WARNING SHOULD BE REMOVED.	   ***
! Jun 2010 / lwk:  replaced FFT1 with FFT11;  this gives sensible output,
! but since I cannot be sure that FFT11 has exactly the same FFT format
! conventions as the old FFT1, and the documentation for FFT1PIX does not
! contain numerical examples, I cannot be positive that the program behaves
! exactly as intended.  Therefore, these notes are retained in the test pdf.
! (Caveat emptor.)
