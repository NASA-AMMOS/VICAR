 FFT1PIX
.HELP
 FFT1PIX  is  a  VICAR application program which works in conjunction
 with  FFT1  to  allow  the user to display and/or modify the Fourier
 transform  using  existing VICAR programs.  The procedure is similar
 to  that  used  in  FFT2,  FFTPIC,  and  TPIKMASK  but  without  the
 restriction  that  terms  of  the transform be either set to zero or
 left  unchanged.   In  the forward mode, the input to fft1pix is the
 complex Fourier transform from FFT1.  The output can be an amplitude
 picture  and/or a phase picture of the transform.  Those can then be
 modified to the users needs and re-inputed to fft1pix in the reverse
 mode.   The  Fourier transform is then modified in accordance to the
 changes made to the amplitude and/or phase pictures.

 Let

 z(k) = a(k) + ib(k) 
 
 be  the  k'th  term  of  the  Fourier  series  of a given line.  The
 amplitude   of   this   term   is   |z|   and  the  phase  angle  is
 atan(b(k)/a(k)).   Then  the  DN of the k'th sample in the amplitude
 picture equals is p*|z|, where p is a scaling factor.

 If  the log option is used, DN = p*LOG(|z|).  p is determined by the
 normalization  options  used.  Similarly the DN of the phase picture
 is given by:

 DN = q * (phase angle) + s

 where q and s are scaling factors.  If NOSIGN is requested,

 DN = q * |phase angle| + s.

 If  requested, then the amplitude and phase pictures are written out
 on  the primary and secondary output data sets.  In addition, a page
 plot of the amplitudes may be printed on the line printer, providing
 a  means  of accurately locating noise spikes in the transform.  The
 user  may  now  modify the amplitude or phase picture using existing
 VICAR programs.  For example, Noise spikes may be QSAR'ed out of the
 amplitude picture.

 The  modified  amplitude  and  phase  pictures are now re-input into
 fft1pix  in  the  reverse  mode.   The  complex*8 transform data set
 remains  as  the  primary  input, the modified amplitude picture the
 secondary input, and the modified phase picture the third input.  If
 the amplitude or phase picture was not modified, then it need not be
 re-input  to  fft1pix.   Each  term  of  the  original  transform is
 compared  to  the  corresponding  term of the modified amplitude and
 phase  pictures; if the amplitude differs, the term is recomputed to
 match  that of the amplitude picture with phase angle preserved.  If
 the  phase  angle  differs  from  the  phase  picture,  the  term is
 recomputed  to match the new phase angle, amplitude preserved.  Thus
 the  user  has complete control over each term of the transform.  If
 CONJ  is not specified in the reverse mode, the complex conjugate of
 a  term  is  automatically  modified  in the identical manner to its
 conjugate  term.   The output is a complex*8 data set containing the
 Fourier  transform  after  modifications  have  been made to it.  If
 requested,  a page plot is made of the transform after modification.

 The modified transform is now ready to be input into FFT1 in inverse
 mode to produce the resulting image.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
1-3 input data set(s)
.VARIABLE OUT
0-2 Output data set(s)
.VARIABLE TYPE
Type of output picture
(AMPL or PHASE)
.VARIABLE LOG
Output is a logarithm
of amplitude picture
.VARIABLE SPIKE
Scale the amplitude picture to 
this spike
.VARIABLE NORMAL
Normalize the amplitude picture 
to the spike
.VARIABLE NOSIGN

conjugate
.VARIABLE PLOT

.VARIABLE PSPIKE

.VARIABLE FREQ
Use 'FREQUENCY' as page plot x-axis 
.VARIABLE REVERSE

.VARIABLE DC

.VARIABLE GAIN
REAL -  a gain factor is applied to each line
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 In the forward mode, only one input is allowed.

 In the reverse mode, up to three input files are allowed.  The first
 input  is  the  picture on which to operate, the second input is the
 modified  amplitude picture, and the third input is (optionally) the
 modified phase picture.
.VARIABLE OUT
 Up to two outputs are allowed.  No output is needed if only the page
 plot is desired.

 If  only one output is provided, the type of output is controlled by
 the TYPE parameter.
.VARIABLE TYPE
 If  two  output  files  are given, TYPE is ignored, and an amplitude
 picture  is  written to the first output, and a phase picture to the
 second. 

 If  only  one  output  is  specified, then TYPE controls the type of
 output;  AMPL  specifies  an amplitude output, and PHASE specifies a
 phase output.
.VARIABLE LOG
 If  LOG  is  specified,  then the logarithm of the amplitude picture
 output.   This  is  recommended  if  the  amplitude picture is to be
 MASK'ed or FOTO'ed.
.VARIABLE SPIKE

 If  SPIKE  is  given,  then  each  line  of the amplitude picture is
 normalized  to  the  SPIKE'th peak for that line.  If NORMAL is also
 specified,  then each line is normalized to the SPIKE'th peak of the
 first line.  (default = dc term)

.VARIABLE NORMAL
 AMPLITUDE PICTURE NORMALIZED TO SPECIFIED SPIKE OF FIRST LINE.
.VARIABLE NOSIGN
 THE SIGN OF THE PHASE ANGLE IS IGNORED IN THE OUTPUT PHASE 
 PICTURE.
.VARIABLE CONJ
 THE COMPLEX CONJUGATE OF THE TRANSFORM IS INCLUDED IN BOTH
 THE AMPLITUDE AND THE PHASE PICTURES.
.VARIABLE PLOT
 PLOT,L1,L2, ------ AN AMPLITUDE PLOT IS PRODUCED OF LINES L1,
 L2,... ETC. (MAX OF 20)  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE OUTPUT 
 OF POWER, ONLY LINE BY LINE.
.VARIABLE AVG
 AVG,I ----- THE I LINES PRECEDING LINE L ARE AVERAGED IN THE
 PAGE PLOT OF LINE L. 
.VARIABLE PSPIKE
 PSPIKE,I ----- PAGE PLOT NORMALIZED TO I'TH PEAK (DEFAULLT = 2)
.VARIABLE FREQ
 FREQUENCY GIVEN AS X - AXIS OF PAGE PLOT. (DEFAULT = TERM 
 NUMBER OF FOURIER COEF.)
.VARIABLE REVERSE
 REVERSE MODE. THE PRIMARY INPUT IS THE COMPLEX*8 DATA SET FROM
 FFT1. THE SECONDARY AND THIRD INPUT DATA SETS ARE REFERENCE 
 AMPLITUDE AND/OR PHASE PICTURES BY WHICH THE TRANSFORM WILL
 BE MODIFIED AND WRITTEN ON THE OUTPUT DATA SET.
 (IN THE REVERSE MODE, IF ANY OF THE PARMS "LOG", "SPIKE,I", "NORMAL",
  "PLOT,L1,L2", "AVG,I", "PSPIKE,I", "FREQ", IS SPECIFIED, 
  IT DENOTES THAT THE SPECIFIED PARM WAS USED IN THE FORWARD
  MODE. THE PARM "CONJ" IS NOT NORMALLY USED IN THE REVERSE 
  MODE. IF USED, IT DENOTES THAT THE COMPLEX CONJUGATE OF 
  THE TRANSFORM IS TO BE MODIFIED INDEPENDENTLY .  THIS COULD
  PRODUCE UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS.)
.VARIABLE DC
 DC,R ----- THE DC TERM OF EACH LINE WILL BE INCREASED BY AN
 AMOUNT R. THIS WILL CAUSE THE AVERAGE GRAY LEVEL OF THE 
 PICTURE TO BE INCREASED BY R AFTER THE INVERSE TRANSFORM.
.VARIABLE GAIN
 GAIN,R ----- A GAIN FACTOR OF R IS APPLIED TO EACH LINE.
 THIS WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A CONTRAST STRETCH AFTER
 THE INVERSE TRANSFORM.
