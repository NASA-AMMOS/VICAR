.TITLE
VICAR Program "detstat"
.HELP
PURPOSE
 An application program which outputs statistical images
 of the input image by measuring the variance of the 
 of the neighboring pixels.

EXECUTION:

  DETSTAT IN OUT MODE WIN
where
  IN is the input image (BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, DOUB),
  OUT is one of 4 possible output images (always REAL),
  MODE is one of the three options discussed below
  WIN is the size of the window around the center pixel to
   perform the calculations.

WIN must be an odd number, >= 3, and is always square,
default=5.
MODE has the following valid values: 1, 2, 3, or 4,
Default=1.

OPERATION:

Detstat derives a statistical relationship of a pixel
to its neighbors. The 4 statistical relationships supported
are:

MODE=1 The center pixel is subtracted from all of its
    neighbors in the window. The absolute value of those 
    differences are then averaged.

MODE=2 The window is averaged without the center pixel.

MODE=3 The window is averaged, then subtracted from the
    pixel and that value is squared.

MODE=4 The center pixel is subtracted from all of its
    neighbors in the window. The differences are then
    averaged. (Will give negative values.)

The edge pixels are only averaged with internal pixels.
Thus, the window size is reduced at the image boundaries.

Internally, all data read in in DOUB format, no matter
what input format is. Output is always REAL.
