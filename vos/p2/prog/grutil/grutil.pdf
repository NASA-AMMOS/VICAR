PURPOSE

    GRUTIL is a utility program for IBIS graphics-1 format files.
It can append files, convert between 3D and 2D files, etc.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
The input graphics file(s)
.VARIABLE OUT
The output graphics file(s)
.VARIABLE DIM
The dimension of the input
graphics files
.VARIABLE OPTION
Keyword for the operation
to perform:
'APPEND  to append files
'SWAP    to swap first two 
          coords in each set
          (e.g. x-y to y-x)
'3DTO2D  to convert a 3D file
          to multiple 2D files
'2DTO3D  to convert multiple 2D
          files to a 3D file
'REDIM   to change dimension of
          file
'FILL    to add points to line
          strings
'SMOOTH  to lower resolution of
          file by deleting points
.VARIABLE OUTDIM
The dimension of the output
file for REDIM option.
.VARIABLE INTERVAL
The point spacing for the
FILL and SMOOTH options.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
The input graphics file(s).  The maximum number of files is 19.
.VARIABLE OUT
The output graphics file(s).  The maximum number of files is 19.
.VARIABLE DIM
The dimension of the input graphics files.
.VARIABLE OPTION
Keyword for the operation to perform:
'APPEND  Appends graphics files.  All of the input files are assumed
           to have dimension of DIM.  Output file has same dimension.

'SWAP    Swaps first two coordinates of each set (e.g. x-y to y-x).

'3DTO2D  Converts a 3D file whose third coordinate is a file or level 
           number to multiple 2D files.  The file number of a line string
           is the integer part of the third coordinate in the first set.
           Linestrings whose file number is outside the range (one to
           the number of output files) are not output.
           
'2DTO3D  Converts multiple 2D files to one 3D file with the third 
           coordinate containing the file number.  The third coordinate
           in each set (except the zero terminator) contains the file
           number (i.e. 1, 2, . . .).

'REDIM   Changes the dimension of the file.  The dimension of the output
           file is specified with the OUTDIM parameter.  If the output
           dimension is smaller than the input then only the beginning
           coordinates are used.  If the output dimension is larger then
           the extra coordinates are zero.

'FILL    Adds points to line strings so there is a point every INTERVAL
	   distance.  Every point in the input file is transfered to the
	   output file.  If points in the original file are larger than the
	   specified distance apart, then points are added on the joining
	   lines with the appropriate spacing.  The distance calculations
	   are performed in 2-D, i.e. using the first two coordinates.

'SMOOTH  Lowers the spatial resolution of a graphics file by deleting points
	   so that the points are greater than INTERVAL distance apart.
	   The first point in every line string is output.  Succeeding points
	   are output if they are greater than the specified distance from
	   the previously output point.  The distance calculations
	   are performed in 2-D, i.e. using the first two coordinates.

.VARIABLE OUTDIM
The dimension of the output graphics file for the REDIM option.
.VARIABLE INTERVAL
INTERVAL specifies the desired point spacing in the graphcis line strings
for the FILL and SMOOTH options.
