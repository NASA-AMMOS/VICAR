Compute Image Entropy
.HELP
ENTROPY computes the entropy of an image providing a measure of the information
content.   It also calculates the standard deviation of the adjacent 
pixel-to-pixel DN differences.  The program can be run on any VICAR image 
and has current application to Galileo SSI and Cassini ISS.  The results can be
used as an aid in generating predictions for the effectiveness of the ICT,
DCT, BARC and other compression algorithms.

EXECUTION:
 
        ENTROPY  INP=PIC  [AREA=(SL,SS,NL,NS)] ...
                 [DISTFILE=DISTRIBUTION_FILE] ['PHIST] ['ZEROES]
                 ['LABEL] [VALUE=TCL_VAR]

where
        PIC is the input image.  PIC must be a byte image.  PIC may be
        arbitrarily large.
 
        (OPTIONAL) AREA specifies the area or region of the input image
        which is to be used as the basis of the entropy calculation.  If
        AREA is not specified, then the entropy of the entire image is
        used.  The area is specified as four integers:
                AREA=(SL,SS,NL,NS)
        where
                SL = starting line of the image area
                SS = starting sample of the image area
                NL = number of lines in the image area
                NS = number of samples in the image area
 
        (OPTIONAL) DISTRIBUTION_FILE is the output file name for the
        normalized difference histogram.
 
        (OPTIONAL) 'PHIST controls whether or not a histogram of the
        differences between adjacent pixels is printed to the screen.
        Note: This requires a 132 column display.
 
        (OPTIONAL) 'ZEROES will cause differences having zero frequencies to
        be included in the printout (normally these are excluded).
        Note:  This keyword does not affect the data written to
        DISTRIBUTION_FILE.

        (OPTIONAL) 'LABEL will update the VICAR label with the computed 
         entropy value.  This keyword only works with CASSINI images.

        (OPTIONAL) TCL_VAR stores the computed entropy value into a TCL 
        variable, which can be passed to another VICAR program.
 
 
RESTRICTIONS:
 
        PIC must be a byte or halfword format.
        Number of samples may not exceed 10000.
        Input DN must be in the range 0 - 4095

OPERATION:
 
The entropy of an image is defined as follows (see ref. 2, pages 2-5).
 
        ENTROPY = - SIGMA(p log p )
                       j   j   2 j
where
        p  =  probability that two horizontally adjacent pixels have
         j    a difference j, where  -4095<j<4095.
and the summation is taken from j=-4095 to +4095.  Entropy is in units of
bits/pixel.

Specifying the optional output file, DISTFILE, will cause the program to
create a file containing the normalized pixel-to-pixel difference
distribution.  This file contains differences having zero frequencies,
i.e., it is complete.
 
If the keyword 'PHIST is specified, a histogram of the differences
between adjacent pixels is printed.  Specifying 'ZEROES will cause differences
having zero frequencies to be included in the printout (normally these are
excluded).  'ZEROES has no affect on the data written to the difference
distribution file.
 
Example:  ENTROPY  INP=input.dat AREA=(193,218,10,10)
 
Example:  ENTROPY  INP=input.dat (193,218,10,10) DISTFILE=diffhist.dat
 
Example:  ENTROPY  INP=input.dat DISTFILE=diffhist.dat  'PHIST  'ZEROES
 
Example:  ENTROPY  input.dat diffhist.dat  'PHIST  'ZEROES

WRITTEN BY:  Mike Malcom, 15 July 1989
COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  Gary Yagi
1994-04-03 - Added automatic capability to print out the name of the input
             file.  This is useful for identifying results when ENTROPY is used in a
             large PDF file
1996-08-01 - Added AREA parameter to allow specifying part of image to process.
1996-09-07 - Added calculation of SIGMA_DELTA_DN and optional capability to
             write normalized difference histogram to a file.  Output also includes
             number of points used in calculations.
1997-07-10 TXH - ported from VAX/VMS to UNIX and ALPHA/VMS.
                 Included changes made by CCA and combined 
                 features that were added on the MIPS' version
                 during software maintenance.  Now, the program will
                 support images from Galileo and Cassini.
2000-04-20 CCA - added halfword capability (to 4095),
                 label add and output to TCL variable.
                 made un-project-specific by putting results into
                 history label instead of property label.  Extended
                 field for reporting number of pixels used.  Fixed
                 help and test files.
2016-08-15 WLB - Removed non-ascii characters and VMS from entropy.pdf. Removed
                 VMS/DCL calls from, and enabled session log in tstentropy.pdf.
