.title
Computes the min and max DN and their first locations and 
copies these to TAE variables
.help
 PURPOSE:

MAXMIN is a VICAR program which finds and prints the minimum and 
maximum DN values in an image.  It optionally returns these values
in TCL variables.
.PAGE
EXECUTION

MAXMIN supports two and three dimensional VICAR images and all valid
VICAR data types.  For complex data, MAXMIN finds the values of minimum 
and maximum magnitude (Fortran CABS function) and reports these values 
as REAL*4 values.  MAXMIN supports all valid VICAR file organizations
(BSQ,BIL,BIP).

MAXMIN prints the location in (line,sample) format for both the minimum
and maximum location.  The band number is also printed if the number 
of bands is greater than 1.  If the minimum or maximum value occur
more than once, the location of the first occurrence will be printed.

The execution time of MAXMIN can be reduced by specifying a LINC parameter
value greater than 1.  In this case, only one out of every LINC lines
in the image is examined.  This may produce acceptable results if the image
data is fairly continuous and if an approximate minimum and maximum are
acceptable.

An EXCLUDE value can be specified to exclude a particular value in the
search for the minimum and maximum.   
.PAGE
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:

      maxmin INP=a
      maxmin INP=a SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) 
      maxmin INP=a SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) BANDS=(sb,nb)
      maxmin a (sl,ss,nl,ns) (sb,nb) opt. parameters MINIVAL=var1 MAXIVAL=var2

       Here 'a' represents the input image file name,
       and 'var1' and 'var2' represent TCL variables of type real
       in which the minimum and maximum values are returned.
.PAGE
EXAMPLES

1.    maxmin INP=A BANDS=(5,2) MINIVAL=MINVALA MAXIVAL=MAXVALA EXCLUDE=0

      In this example MAXMIN finds the minimum and maximum values (excluding 0)
      for the portion of image A contained in bands 5 and 6.
      These values are returned in the TCL variables MINVALA, MAXVALA.

2.    The following example show how to convert a double precision
      image to byte format using appropriate scaling obtained from
      MAXMIN output.  Program CFORM will map the minimum value to 0
      and the maximum value to 255.

        procedure
        refgbl $echo
        LOCAL minvar REAL
        LOCAL maxvar REAL
        body
        let _onfail="continue"
        let $echo="yes"
        gen a 10 10 'REAL8
        maxmin a MINIVAL=minvar MAXIVAL=maxvar
        putmsg "Stretch this image to byte format" ""
        cform a b 'BYTE IRANGE=(&minvar, &maxvar) ORANGE=(0, 255)
        end-proc

3.    The following example show how to get a histogram of a REAL*4
      image using as histogram limits the minimum and maximum obtained from
      MAXMIN output.  Program HIST is used to generate the histogram.

        procedure
        refgbl $echo
        LOCAL minvar REAL
        LOCAL maxvar REAL
        body
        let _onfail="continue"
        let $echo="yes"
        gen a 10 10 ival=-100 sinc= 5500 'REAL
        maxmin a MINIVAL=minvar MAXIVAL=maxvar
        hist a limits=(&minvar, &maxvar) 
        end-proc

.level2
.vari inp
Name of a single input file.
.vari out
Name of a single output file.
.vari size
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which the MAXMIN is to take place.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line
.vari bands
The bands parameter determines the bands in the input
file from which the MAXMIN is to take place.  It is specified
as (SB,NB), where
	SB is the starting band
	NB is the number of bands to be copied
.vari linc
The execution time of MAXMIN can be reduced by specifying a LINC parameter
value greater than 1.  In this case, only one out of every LINC lines
in the image is examined.  This may produce acceptable results if the image
data is fairly continuous and if an approximate minimum and maximum are
acceptable.  The default for LINC is 1.
.vari exclude
An EXCLUDE value can be specified to exclude a particular value in the
search for the minimum and maximum.   The EXCLUDE parameter is a REAL*4 value,
and is rounded to the nearest integer for images with integral pixel values.
For images of the complex data type, EXCLUDE is REAL*4, and it is the 
magnitudes of the pixel values that are compare against EXCLUDE.

In MAXMIN, the minimum and maximum are set to EXCLUDE if all of
the values in the image are equal to EXCLUDE.  (That would be a flat image.)

The default is to not exclude any values
.vari minival
MAXMIN optionally returns the minimum pixel value (DN) in the image into
a TCL variable (of type real).  The command line syntax for this parameter
is MINIVAL=var1, where 'var1' represents the TCL variable of type real
in which the minimum value is returned.
The minimum value is returned if and only if this parameter is specified.
.vari maxival
MAXMIN optionally returns the maximum pixel value (DN) in the image into
a TCL variable (of type real).  The command line syntax for this parameter
is MAXIVAL=var1, where 'var1' represents the TCL variable of type real
in which the maximum value is returned.
The maximum value is returned if and only if this parameter is specified.
