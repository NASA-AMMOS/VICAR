PURPOSE

	"aggrg2" collapses columns of numbers in an IBIS interface file into
smaller columns using a designated column as the control. Within the control
column each number which is repeated will define one row. A second key or
index, the area key, selects the maximum value from an index group and stores
is row position in the column. The row position is a pointer from which a
sample can be selected for other columns.

	There are three alternative methods of collapsing columns:

1. The first option selects a sample item from a column based on the row
position of the maximum value from the key column. One value is selected
for each group of control values.

2. The second option aggregates all the values in a column based on the
limits defined by the control values.

3. The third option selects a maximum value from the column based on the
limits defined by the control values (default).

	To illustrate the options a sample case is shown:

CONTROL AREA	SAMPLE		CONTROL	OPTION	OPTION	OPTION
COLUMN	KEY	COLUMN		COLUMN	ONE	TWO	THREE
1	10	 2		1	 4	12	 6
1	20	 4		2	10	18	10
1	15	 6		3	16	42	16
2	24	 8		4	18	18	18
2	31	10		5	20	20	20
3	16	12
3	31	14
3	53	16
4	10	18
5	20	20

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

	aggrg2 INP=FILE OUT=FILE2 AGCOL=N AREA=A BYAR=(X,Y,Z) SUMCOL=(A,B,C)
	aggrg2 INP=FILE OUT=FILE2 AGCOL=N SUMCOL=(X,Y,Z)

	FILE represents the interface file, N the control column,
	A the keyword area, X,Y, and Z the columns to be collapsed,
	and A,B, and C the columns to be collapsed by aggregating
	all the values for an index group.

EXAMPLE

	sort INP=A SORTCOL=1
	aggrg2 INP=A OUT=B AGCOL=1

	This example collapses the interface file by replacing multiple
rows with the same value in column 1 by a single row and choosing the
largest value in the other rows to be retained.

RESTRICTIONS

The interface file can be sorted on the AGCOL, but it does not have to
be.  It will be collapsed on each set of contiguous values, using
the breaks between them to identify the sets.  For example if the 
agcol contains (0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0) then 7 sets of 
contiguous values will be recognized.

Dynamic allocation is used so the columns can be of any length.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Standard IBIS input file.
.VARIABLE OUT
Standard IBIS output file.
.VARIABLE AGCOL
Control column number.
.VARIABLE AREA
Area maximum key.
.VARIABLE BYAR
Columns to be collapsed by the
first option.
.VARIABLE SUMCOL
Columns to be collapsed by
aggregating all values for
an index group.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Standard IBIS interface file
of 512 samples by N lines.
.VARIABLE OUT
Standard IBIS interface file
of 512 samples by N lines.
.VARIABLE AGCOL
This column number is used as
a control for the columns to
be compressed. Each number
repeated in this column will
form 1 row on the output file.
THE COLUMN DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
SORTED, IT WORKS ON "BREAKS" IN
THE DATA.  FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN
USE
    0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
TO GET SEVEN RECORDS OUT.
.VARIABLE AREA
This column is used as an area
maximum key. The maximum value
is found in each index group
and stored by row position.
This row position is a pointer
to the same positions in other
columns.
.VARIABLE BYAR
These are the columns to be
collapsed by the first option,
that is select one sample row
position for each index group
by the maximum key area.
.VARIABLE SUMCOL
These are the columns to be
collapsed by aggregating all
values for an index group.
