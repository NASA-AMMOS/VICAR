PURPOSE:
fftmagic provides an iterative method for obtaining either the phase from the
amplitude or the amplitude from the phase of a Fourier transform.  The
technique is controversial and may not work for all images. 

 
EXECUTION:

Examples

fftmagic INP=(EST,REF) OUT=PIC 

This command will read estimate picture EST and reference picture REF as byte
data (default), and create an output picture, PIC, also in byte format, whose
Fourier transform will correspond in amplitude (default) to that of REF.
Up to 100 iterations will be performed (default), and negative pixels on odd
iterations will be multiplied by -0.5 (the negative default of BETA).

fftmagic INP=(EST,REF) OUT=PIC  'OUTINTEG 'PHASE

This command is similar, except that the output picture will be in
in integer format, as specified by the OUTINTEG command, instead
of the default, which is to match the format of the input pictures; other
output format specifications include OUTREAL, OUTBYTE, and OUTHALF.  Finally,
the output picture's Fourier transform will be matched in PHASE to that of
the reference picture (REF), instead of matching amplitude as in the example
above.  The omitted keywords are INPFMT, OUTFMT, and MODE, respectively.

fftmagic INP=(EST,REF) OUT=PIC ITER=200 'PRINT  BETA=0.75

This command will again read the input pictures in byte format, but will this
time perform up to 200 iterations.  Normally, the program will iterate until no
pixels have changed, or 100 loops have been made; in this case, the program
will use up to 200 iterations.  The PRINT option specified above causes the
number of pixels changed and the sum of the negative pixels to be printed at
each iteration.  Finally, negative pixels will be multiplied by -BETA = -0.75
instead of the default -0.5.

fftmagic INP=(EST,REF) OUT=PIC PSF=(1,100,20,40)

This command demonstrates the use of the PSF keyword.  PSF specifies the
(line, sample, radius) triplets needed to describe point spread functions in 
the REF image.  These triplets are preceded by the number of triplets to be
used; in this case, there is one point spread function, centered at line 100,
sample 20, and with a radius of 40.  Additional triplets can follow as
necessary.  When PSF is specified, each center position is re-centered at the
max DN value in each circular area and the sum of the pixels less background
(determined from the border points) is computed for the values within each
circle.  The, for each iteration, all of the points inside each circle are
set to the mean DN plus the sum of the DN's as previously computed.  PSF acts
as an additional boundary condition for stellar-type point spread functions.


Notes and Restrictions

1) Both FFT's must reside in core together.  Together they take NxNx8 bytes if
   N is the picture dimension.
2) (Timing restriction belonging here will be inserted when VAX benchmarks
   have been run.)  (Was:  For 64x64 pictures each iteration consumes about
   4 seconds.)


OPERATION:
fftmagic computes and stores in core the FFT's of the initial estimate picture
and the reference picture.  It then forces the amplitude or phase of the 
estimate to match that of the reference.  The inverse FFT is taken and all
negative DN's are multiplied by -BETA (as specified by the BETA keyword) on the
odd iterations and by 0 on the even iterations.  If PSF has been specified, 
then star images are also set to delta functions.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the initial estimate picture (EST) and the reference picture 
(REF).  The initial estimate picture will be used to obtain the unknown part
of the Fourier transform.  EST is usually a random noise scene.  The reference
picture's Fourier transform will be used (either the amplitude or the phase)
as a "known" quantity.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT specifies the picture whose Fourier transform corresponds either in phase
or amplitude to REF after ITER iterations.
.VARIABLE OUTFMT
OUTFMT specifies the format for output data.  The valid values are OUTBYTE,
OUTHALF, OUTINTEG, and OUTREAL.  The default is to use the format of the
input pictures.
.VARIABLE MODE
MODE=PHASE (or 'PHASE) specifies that the phase of the reference picture (REF)
will be used as a boundary condition, leaving the amplitude to be determined. 
The default is for the amplitude to be used as the boundary condition. 
.VARIABLE ITER
ITER specifies the maximum number of iterations allowed.  If no pixels are 
reset on any pass, the iteration process is terminated.  Default is ITER=100.
.VARIABLE PRINT
'PRINT causes the number of pixels changed and the sum of the
negative pixels to be printed at each iteration.  
.VARIABLE BETA
BETA specifies the real value to be multiplied by each negative pixel in order
to render it positive or zero.  The negative of BETA is used in the program,
and only every other iteration is used.  The default is BETA = 0.5 .
.VARIABLE PSF
The PSF keyword is used in the form PSF=(N,L1,S1,R1,...,Ln,Sn,Rn), where 
each L, S, and R triplet specifies the line, sample, and radius of a 
point-spread function in the reference (REF) image.  If PSF is specified,
each center position is re-centered at the max DN value in each circular area
and the sum of the pixels less background (determined from the border points)
is computed for the values within the circle.  Then, for each iteration, all
of the points inside each circle are set to the mean DN of the border points
and the central pixel is set to the mean DN plus the sum of the DN's as
previously computed.  PSF acts as an additional boundary condition for stellar-
type point-spread functions.
