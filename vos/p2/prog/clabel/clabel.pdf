VICAR Program "clabel"---
       Adds contour label information to a file that has been generated
       by "polyscrb" from a file generated by "contour".
.help
PURPOSE:

"clabel" will read the contour information generated by the program,
"contour", after "contour's" output graphics file has been expanded by
the program, "polyscrb". "clabel" will generate a "font" parameter file,
and "font" may be used to add labels to the contour file.
.page
OPERATION:


"clabel" should be used in the following sequence:

	contour A B
	polyscrb B C
	copy C D
	clabel D
	font C E

Note that "clabel" will destroy the contents of its input file, and
that it will create a parameter file that the program, "font", will accept.
The labeled contours will appear in the output of "font".

.level1
.vari inp
"polyscrb'd" output contour file.
.vari minlen
Minimum contour length to be labeled.
.vari trans
Label = trans[0]*dn + trans[1]
.vari fontht
Height in pixels of font.
.vari font
Integer representing font type.
.level2
.vari inp
The single input file to "clabel" which must be an expanded contour
file such as would be produced if the program, "polyscrb", operating 
on a graphics file produced by the program, "contour".
.vari minlen
A contour in the input contour file with length less than 'minlen'
will not be labeled.
.vari trans
The label, which is taken from the dn in the image corresponding
to the contour, will be transformed by LABEL=TRANS[0]*DN+TRANS[1].
.vari fontht
The height of the text in the label in pixels.
.vari font
The type of font to use in the labels. The font type is
taken from those available in the program, "font".
