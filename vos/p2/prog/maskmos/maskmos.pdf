VICAR program maskmos

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Converts map projected images into masks for input to NEWMOS.

EXECUTION:

maskmos may be executed in the following manner:

		maskmos INP=(A1,A2,...An) OUT=(B1,B2,...Bn)

.PAGE
OPERATION:

Maskmos creates masks from input projected images. Later they will be used
by Newmos to mosaic images in the "smooth" option.
Provide to Maskmos the same set of images that would be input to Newmos.
Maskmos will create another set of images.  All these images, original
 and mask images, will then be given to Newmos in the 'smooth mode.

Maskmos converts an input image into a HALF format image with the 
following properties:
1. Zero dn input values will be zero dn on output.
2. Points on the edge of the input projected data or on the edge of
   the input frame if the projected data reaches the picture border
   are set to one. These are Border points.
3. All pixels which are not zero will be set to a dn value which is 
   their distance from the Border points.

ASSUMPTIONS:
(1) That MAP3 has been run on the input images, generating
    a zero border .
(2) That the image can be fit into memory. Current buffer limits
    permit up to 1500 by 1500 pixel inputs. This is easily changed.
(3) Newmos uses the image labels to compute offfsets. Make sure that
    Maskmos gets projected inputs so it can preserve the label.

EXAMPLE:
(1)
         map3 inp=p1 out=a1 ...
         map3 inp=p2 out=a2 ...
         map3 inp=p3 out=a3 ...
         maskmos inp=(a1,a2,a3) out=(b1,b2,b3)
         newmos inp=(a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3) out=m 'smooth
(2)
     An input image which looks like this:
           0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
           0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0
           0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0
           0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0
           0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0
           0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0

     would be converted to this:
           0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
           0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
           0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 0
           0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 0
           0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 0
           0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
STRING-input datasets.
.VARI OUT
STRING-output datasets.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Up to 100 input images.
.VARI OUT
The same number or outputs as inputs.
These are the masks of the corresponding inputs.
All masks are half format.
