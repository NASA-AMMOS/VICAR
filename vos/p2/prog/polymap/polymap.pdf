VICAR/IBIS Program POLYMAP

PURPOSE

     POLYMAP  is used to convert point or polygon files from 
     one  map  projection  to  another.    The  file  to  be 
     converted  must  be  in the  standard  VICAR  polygonal 
     format (sequence of points X1,Y1,X2,Y2,...  in fullword 
     floating).   Several map projections are supported (see
     parameters).

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     POLYMAP INP=A OUT=B PARAMS

     where

     INP                 is  an input point on polygon  file 
                         in  the  standard  VICAR  polygonal 
                         format.
     
     OUT                 is the output file in the  standard 
                         IBIS format.

     PARAMS              is a standard VICAR parameter field.

OPERATION

     POLYMAP  performs  the map transformation indicated  by 
     the  keyword  to transform an input x,y  pair  into  an 
     output  x,y  pair.    It  is  expected  that  more  map 
     transformations will be added when needed.

          PROJ=UTM       specifies  that  the conversion  is 
                         from  lat-long to UTM.   The  first 
                         point  to be  converted  determines 
                         the UTM zone, which is printed out, 
                         and  then all points are referenced 
                         to that UTM zone even if they would 
                         ordinarily  fall in  another  zone.  
                         This  is  done to provide a  single 
                         map projection for the entire  data 
                         set.

          PROJ=LAMBERT   specifies  that the  conversion  is 
                         from lat-long to Lambert  Conformal 
                         Conic  with two standard  parallels          
                         L,U   stated  in  degrees  with   a 
                         decimal point.   The default L,U is 
                         33.,45.

          PROJ=ALBERS    specifies  that  the conversion  is 
                         from  lat-long to Albers Equal Area 
                         Projection   with   two    standard          
                         parallels  L,U  stated  in  degrees 
                         with  a decimal point.  The default 
                         L,U is 33.,45.

          PROJ=ALBERS2   specifies  that the  conversion  is 
                         from lat-long to a special formula-
                         tion  of  the  Albers  Equal  Area
                         Projection which includes eccentri-
                         city of the spheroid.  The standard 
                         parallels  L,U have default  values 
                         of 33.,45.
     
          PROJ=LANDSAT   specifies    that   the   geometric 
                         transformation  contained  in   the 
                         routine  ERTMGEOM is to be  applied 
                         so that points in the raw image can 
                         be  moved to their location in  the 
                         logged   image. The next five key-
                         words must be specified.    
          PROJ=SOM       Specifies  Space  Oblique  Mercator
                         projection.

     LATI=RLAT           image  with  ERTMGEOM so  the  same 
     SENS=N              transformation  can  be applied  to 
     BAND=K              the point data set. L and S are the

                         RLAT is the latitude of the Landsat

                         platform.   Currently  N=1,2,3  for 
                         Landsat   1,2,3  respectively.    K

                         platform.   Currently  N=1,2,3  for 
                         Landsat   1,2,3  respectively.    K 
                         specifies  which band was  used  to 
                         locate  the  point set in  the  raw 
                         frame (currently 4 through 7).  K=0 
                         can  be used if no band offsets are

                         specifies  which band was  used  to

                         frame (currently 4 through 7).  K=0 
                         can  be used if no band offsets are 
                         used.
.VARIABLE BAND
     INSI(1)=L           These  keywords specify the parame

                         RLAT is the latitude of the Landsat

.VARIABLE STPAR
     STPAR=(L,U)         Standard parallels in degrees, used 
                         for  LAMBERT,  ALBERS  and  ALBERS2 
                         projections. L-lower, U-upper.
                         Default: L=33., U=45.

.VARIABLE CMER

                         projection.
.VARIABLE INCON
     INCON=(C1,...,C6)    This  specifies an input conversion 
                         prior  to  application of  the  map 
                         transformation:               

                         X' = C1.X +C2.Y + C3

.VARIABLE SKIP
     SKIP=n              This is used for skipping nominal 
     			 data.  Two data words are read and
			 then n words are skipped, etc.
			 The skipped data are carried along
			 unchanged to the output file.

.VARIABLE IGNORE
     IGNORE=(x,y)        causes  all points with  the  value 
                         (x,y)   to   be  ignored   by   the 
                         transformation.   The default is to 
                         ignore  (0.,0.).   x and y must  be 
                         given in floating format.
.VARIABLE ZONE
     ZONE=z              The   integer  z  forces  a   zonal 
                         mapping  (such  as UTM) to be in  a 
                         specific zone.  The negative of the
			 zone number is used to indicate that
			 the UTM coordinates are in the 
			 Southern hemisphere.
.VARIABLE MODE
      'INVERSE		 Does inverse transformation

.VARIABLE PATH           Specifies satellite path for SOM
     PATH=p              projection
