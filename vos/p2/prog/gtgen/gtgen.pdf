GTGEN - Program for creating a VICAR GeoTIFF label file.
.HELP
PURPOSE
     GTGEN is a VICAR applications program which creates a GeoTIFF
     label from parameter input.  This label can be used as a reference
     for numerous VICAR/IBIS operations such as mapping a graphics
     data set or an image.  The label can be examined with the 
     routine GTLIST, including calculated information such as location
     of corner points and pixel size.  The label is coded as a
     part of the state VICAR label.  It can be inserted into an IBIS
     file for graphics or tabular data with routine GTIBIS (not
     available yet).
     
     A special feature of GTGEN is that a three tiepoint set of
     parameters can be converted into a tiepoint-scale or tiepoint-
     transformation-matrix format of GeoTIFF label.  Often, the
     three tiepoints are known or are easier to work with than the
     internal formats of GeoTIFF.  This feature is invoked by the
     keyword TIECNVRT.  If the three tiepoints are not exactly
     rectilinear (which can be proven by using GTLIST on the result)
     and a rectilinear mapping is desired, then the keyword RECTFIT
     can be used to give a best fit (in the least-squares sense)
     that is rectilinear.
     
     If a VICAR file is created with the GEOTIFF parameter but no
     input data sets, then it will be a 1 x 1 image (one pixel)
     that serves mainly as the holder of the GeoTIFF label.  It 
     would also be useful for the 'COVERINP parameter of VICAR
     program GTSIZE or GTWARP.
     
     GTGEN has six modes of operation, so read the help for 
     parameter INP to determine your case.
     
CALL
     gtgen INP OUT '(QUALIFIERS) GEOTIFF
  WHERE:
     INP            is the input data set (may be none, one, or two).
     OUT            is the output data set (may be none, or one).
     QUALIFIERS     consist of any of the following keywords:
          ADD           add the geotiff parameters to an existing label
          TIECNVRT      convert three tiepoint input to tiepoint-scale-
                        model format to indicate that image is mapped
     GEOTIFF        are tag-value pairs that become geotiff parms in
                    the label; each is formatted tag=value.
OR
     gtgen (INP1,INP2) OUT
  WHERE:
     INP1           is a VICAR input data set(s).
     INP2           is a VICAR input data set that has a GeoTIFF
                    label in its state label area.
     OUT            is a VICAR output data set that will be a copy
                    of the first data set with an inserted GeoTIFF
                    label from the second data set.
     
    
OPERATION

For the normal case of creating a label from parameters,
GTGEN processes the input string pairs, turning each into a
GeoTIFF tag-value pair.

The parameter uses only the string format.  Numbers are presented as
strings.  Vectors are presented as a string containing symbols (,,).
etc.  Double quotes must be doubled inside the TAE double quotes
(see example below).  Parenthetical documentation can be added as
part of the strings.

The format is flattened out for VICAR label purposes.  The higher
level descriptors such as GeoKeyDirectoryTag are not used in the
vicar table.  They are restored when an external GeoTIFF label is
created.   The following example is taken from 3.1.1 of the 
GeoTIFF Format Specification REv 1 (see references).

geotiff=("ModelTiePointTag=(0,0,0,350807.4,5316081.3,0.0)",+
"ModelPixelScaleTag=(100.0,100.0,0.0)",+
"GTModelTypeGeoKey=1(ModelTypeProjected)",+
"GTRasterTypeGeoKey=1(RasterPixelIsArea)",+
"ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey=32660(PCS_WGS84-UTM-zone_60N)",+
"PCSCitationGeoKey=""UTM Zone 60 N with WGS84""")

For the case of two input files, no parameters are allowed.  The 
program simply places the ascii file key=value pairs into the
VICAR state area.  Multiple occurrences of keys become vectors
in the VICAR state area (since repeats of keys are disallowed).

For the update case of one input, no output data sets... the
geotiff parameter is processed in update mode into the primary
input.  This is the fastest way to process large data sets.

PERFORMANCE

Less than 1 second, except for the case where an output file is
written.  Then the time is mostly copying the output data set.

RESTRICTIONS
------------

Only 100 parameter pairs can be input.  For more, use repeated
calls to GTGEN with the 'ADD parameter after the first call.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input file name(s)
There are six cases:
1.  1 output, no add
2.  1 input, 1 output, no add
3.  1 input, 1 output, add
4.  2 input, 1 output
5.  1 input, 0 output (update)
6.  1 input, 0 output (update), add
(see help level 2)
.VARI OUT
output file name
.VARI GEOTIFF
Key-value pairs expressed
as one string per pair
.VARI ADD
The key-value pairs are
added to an existing file
.VARI TIECNVRT
Three tiepoints in the 
parameters are converted to
tiepoint-scale-model
.VARI RECTFIT
Used with TIECNVRT; gives the
rectilinear mapping that best
approximates the tiepoints
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
There are five cases to consider:
1.  single output file, no add.
2.  single input, single output file, no add.
3.  single input, single output file, add.
4.  two input, single output file.
5.  one input, no output (update case)
6.  one input, no output (update case), add

The first case will create a VICAR file from the parameters with
NL=1 NS=1 (i.e., a single pixel).  This is handy as a holder of a
GeoTIFF label.  If a file exists already, it will be erased.

The second case will put the parameters into the state label of a VICAR
image file.  If any state parameters exist, THEY WILL BE ERASED.  This
erasure includes ALL state labels, whether GeoTIFF related or not.

The third case will add the parameters into the state label of a VICAR
image file.  If any state parameters exist, they are kept.  A special
case for TIECNVRT, an existing mapping will be deleted since it doesn't
make sense to have two mappings.

The fourth case will put the GeoTIFF state labels of the second
VICAR input to the state label area of a VICAR image.  If any state
parameters exist, THEY WILL BE ERASED.  This erasure includes ALL
state labels, whether GeoTIFF related or not.

The fifth case will put the parameters into the state label of a VICAR
image file.  If any state parameters exist, they are deleted.  This case
uses update on the vicar label and is the fastest method for large files.

The sixth case will add the parameters into the state label of a VICAR
image file.  If any state parameters exist, they are kept.  This case
uses update on the vicar label and is the fastest method for large files.

.VARI OUT
The output will be a copy of the first input image with a GeoTIFF
label inserted from the parameters or the second input image.

If there is no first input, then the output will be a 1 x 1 image
containing the GeoTIFF label from the parameters.  The GeoTIFF label
will be in the state area of the image.
.VARI GEOTIFF
The key-value pairs are expressed as "key=value".  Double quotes
must be doubled inside the TAE double quotes (see example below).
Parenthetical documentation can be added as part of the strings.

The format is flattened out for VICAR label purposes.  The higher
level descriptors such as GeoKeyDirectoryTag are not used in the
vicar table.  They are restored when an external GeoTIFF label is
created.   The following example is taken from 3.1.1 of the 
GeoTIFF Format Specification REv 1 (see references).

geotiff=("ModelTiePointTag=(0,0,0,350807.4,5316081.3,0.0)",+
"ModelPixelScaleTag=(100.0,100.0,0.0)",+
"GTModelTypeGeoKey=1(ModelTypeProjected)",+
"GTRasterTypeGeoKey=1(RasterPixelIsArea)",+
"ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey=32660(PCS_WGS84-UTM-zone_60N)",+
"PCSCitationGeoKey=""UTM Zone 60 N with WGS84""")

.VARI ADD
Add can only be used in the single input cases.
.VARI TIECNVRT
The GeoTIFF standard implies that a mapped image can be represented
by a single tiepoint and a scale.  Actually, the scale can include
negative values to indicate that the image storage is "flipped" from
the VICAR order (starting at the top left of the image and running
along the top in sample order, then down in line order), or a matrix
indicating that the image is rotated in addition.  These 
representations are very hard for the user to set up, so this
keyword will convert a simpler set of three tiepoints into a
tiepoint-scale-model format, using the model matrix only if needed
(i.e., the simplest format is decided automatically by GTGEN).

Only the first tiepoint is kept, and only the first three are used
to calculate.  TIECNVRT cannot be used with the ADD keyword.

As an example, a DMA DTED can be input (without disturbing its
lines and samples format) by the following tiepoints:

        "ModelTiePointTag=(0,0,0,121.0,25.0,0.0)"
        "ModelTiePointTag=(1200,0,0,121.0,26.0,0.0)"
        "ModelTiePointTag=(0,1200,0,122.0,25.0,0.0)"

DMA DTED also uses RasterPixelIsPoint, and has the rotation diagram

        369
        258
        147
        
where 123 is the first line, 456 is the second line, etc.
.VARI RECTFIT
The cross terms are simply set to zero.  That is, 

       north   =   a * line  +  b * sample  + c
       east    =   d * line  +  e * sample  + f

either (a,c) is set to (0,0) or (b,d) is.  For a rectilinear
image, one of these pairs should be zero, but approximations
or rounding in the tiepoints cause one of the pairs to be small 
numbers close to zero.  Which pair is a function of the rotation
of the image.
