Insert a band into a 3-d multispectral file
.help
PURPOSE:

INSERT3D will place a 2-d band (also called a depth) into 
a 3d file. The band may be inserted between 2 existing 
bands or written over an existing band. The keyword 
'OVER causes overwriting. Inserting is the default.
The first input file is the 3-D file that will receive
the band and the second input is the band to be inserted. 
The output receives the final product unless 'UPDATE is
specified in which case the band is written into the
primary input, and the output file, if present, is ignored.

Example:    INSERT3D  (A,B) C BAND=23 'OVER

Writes B as band 23 over band 23 in A with C receiving the updated
3-D file. A and B are left unchanged.

The file, A, must be a 3-D file in band-sequential organization and B 
a 2-D band (or depth) with the same cross-section (number of lines
and samples) as A.

The program, TRAN, may be used to change the organization of a file.

Example:    INSERT3D (A,B) BAND=116 'UPDATE

Here, the band in B is written directly into A in update mode.

'UPDATE implies 'OVER. The band count of A can not increse in 'UPDATE
mode.

Note that INSERT3D can insert a band into a file after the previous
last band. The BAND value must be one greater than the last band number.

.level1
.vari inp
The inserted and the insertee.
.vari out
The final product.
.vari band
Where to insert.
.vari overwrit
Write over instead of inserting between.
.vari update
Write into the primary input.
.level2
.vari inp
The first input is the 3-D file. The second input is 
the 2-D file containing the band to be inserted.
.vari out
Contains the result of the second input being written
into the first. The inputs are always left unchanged 
by this operation unless 'UPDATE is specified in which
case the primary input is written into and the output,
if present, is ignored.
.vari band
The band number of the band to be overwritten or inserted 
behind, depending on the keyword, 'OVER.
.vari overwrit
Will cause the second input to be overwritten on the selected
band of the first input. Inserting the second file behind the
indicated band of the first file is the default. In this case, 
the output file will have a band count greater by one than 
primary input.
.vari update
Will cause the primary input to recieve the band rather than
the output. 'UPDATE implies 'OVER, that is, in 'UPDATE mode
the new band must overwrite its existing counterpart.
