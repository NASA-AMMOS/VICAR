PURPOSE

    ROWOP performs row operations on an IBIS interface (tabular) file.
There are three modes of operation:  delete, select, and pick.  The modes
all involve checking the values in a row against an input range
of allowed values.  The delete option deletes the rows that satisfy any
range criterion, the select option selects the rows that satify all range
criteria, and the pick option selects the rows that satisfy any range 
criterion.  The changes are made to the output file, not the input file.  
The number of columns is unchanged.


EXECUTION

ROWOP INP=INPUT.INT OUT=OUTPUT.INT   KEYCOL=(C1,C2,..Cn)  +
			RANGE=(L1,U1, L2,U2, ..., Ln,Un)  'mode

    INP is the input IBIS interface file, and OUT is the output IBIS 
interface file.   KEYCOL are the columns for matching data values.  RANGE 
specifies that the values in column Ci of INP are checked against the 
numeric range designated by Li and Ui.  The precision parameter, PREC, 
specifies by how much the range limits will be enlarged to overcome
precision problems;  the lower limit is lowered by P, and the upper
limit is increased by P.  The default for P is zero.  The 'mode parameter
chooses the mode of operation -- how the ranges will be used to select
the rows.


EXAMPLES

ROWOP INP=A OUT=B KEYCOL=(1,1,5) RANGE=(0,10, 100,1000, 20.35,20.35) PREC=0.01

    The delete mode has been invoked.  For each row if the value in 
column one is between -0.01 and 10.01 or between 99.99 and 1000.01, or 
if the value in column five is between 20.34 and 20.36, then the row 
containing those values will be deleted.


ROWOP INP=A OUT=B KEYCOL=(2,6)  RANGE=( 1.5,3.0, 250,400)  'SELECT

    The select mode has been invoked.  For each row if the value in 
column two is between 1.5 and 3.0 inclusive AND the value in column six 
is between 250 and 400 inclusive then the row will be selected.


ROWOP INP=A OUT=B KEYCOL=(1,2)  RANGE=( 1,1, 10,20)  'PICK

    The pick mode has been invoked.  For each row if the value in 
column one is 1  OR  the value in column two is between 10 and 20 
inclusive then the row will be selected.



ROWOP INP=INPUT.INT OUT=OUTPUT.INT   KEYCOL=(C1,C2,..Cn)  +
			RANGE=(L1,U1, L2,U2, ..., Ln,Un)  +
			NCOPY=(N,ICOL)

    The first number, N, in the NCOPY parameter specifies the number of 
times the accepted rows will be copied, and the second number specifies 
which column to put the index number in.  The index number tells which copy 
the row belongs to (1 for the first copy, 2 for the second, etc.)   If no 
index column is specified then the index numbers will not be put in the file.  
The copies are made by copying the whole block of output rows, not by copying 
each row separately.  If the NCOPY parameter is omitted altogether then just 
one copy will be made.


ROWOP IN=A OUT=B KEYCOL=(2,3) RANGE=(-90,90, 0,360) 'SELECT NCOPY=(5,4)

    The select mode has been invoked.  If the values in column two of IN are
between -90 and 90 and those of column three between 0 and 360, then
the rows containing those values are selected (i.e. only those rows 
satisfying all the criterion are copied to the output file).  Five
copies of the selected rows will be made, with the index number going
into column 4.



RESTRICTIONS

    The number of L,U pairs after RANGE must equal the number of columns 
listed after KEYCOL.  The maximum number of rows from the input interface 
file is limited to 1,000,000.  The maximum number of ranges that can be 
checked is 100.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input interface file
.VARIABLE OUT
Output interface file
.VARIABLE KEYCOL
The list of match columns
.VARIABLE RANGE
Lower and upper check limits
.VARIABLE MODE
Keyword for which mode.
DELETE, SELECT, or PICK
.VARIABLE PREC
The precision of the range
limits.
.VARIABLE NCOPY
1. The number of copies
    to make in the output.
2. The index column.
.VARIABLE GR1DIM
Dimension (Graphics-1 only)

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP is the input IBIS interface file.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT is the output IBIS interface file.
.VARIABLE KEYCOL
KEYCOL is list of columns for matching.
.VARIABLE RANGE
RANGE specifies the values in the columns specified by KEYCOL of INP to be
checked against the numeric range designated by the Lower and Upper limits.
.VARIABLE MODE
The MODE keyword specifies the operation mode (DELETE, SELECT, or PICK).
The DELETE mode deletes those rows that satisfy any of the range criterion.
The SELECT mode selects those rows that satify all of the range criteria.
The PICK mode selects those rows that satisfy any of the range criterion. 
The default mode is DELETE.
.VARIABLE PREC
The precision parameter, PREC, specifies by how much the range limits 
will be enlarged to overcome precision problems;  the lower limit is 
lowered by PREC, and the upper limit is increased by PREC.  
The default for P is zero.  
.VARIABLE NCOPY
    The first number in the NCOPY parameter specifies the number of 
times the accepted rows will be copied, and the second number specifies 
which column to put the index number in.  The index number tells which copy 
the row belongs to (1 for the first copy, 2 for the second, etc.)   If no 
index column is specified then the index numbers will not be put in the file.  
The copies are made by copying the whole block of output rows, not by copying 
each row separately.  If the NCOPY parameter is omitted altogether then just 
one copy will be made.
.VARIABLE GR1DIM
GRAPHICS-1 files do not have any explicit dimensions in the
file label. This allows the user to properly dimension a
graphics file so that it may be used by this program.
IBIS-2 format graphics files do not need or use this.
