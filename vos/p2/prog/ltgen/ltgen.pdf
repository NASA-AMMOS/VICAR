VICAR Application Program LTGEN
.HELP
PURPOSE:
 
LTGEN is the first of a sequence of VICAR applications programs which
measure the radiometric properties of a camera system.  The programs
are designed to support radiometric calibration of flight camera systems.
 
 
LTGEN will initialize the Light Transfer File (LTF) by specifying areas
within the image where measurements are to be made, and initializing one
record for each exposure level of the light transfer or reciprocity
sequence.  The next program in the sequence, MOMGEN, then extracts the
moments for each area (sum of DNs, sum of squares of DNs, and cross terms)
and stores these moments in each exposure record.  Finally, data analysis
routines access the LTF and extract camera properties such as:
 
        1) System gain constant and read noise floor (see CCDNOISE).
        2) Light transfer curve slope and offset (see CCDSLOPE).
        3) Shutter offset and camera sensitivity (see CCDRECIP).

OPERATION:
 
The input image (INP) may be any image from the light transfer or
reciprocity test sequence.  The VICAR label of this image is copied
to LTF to help identify the file.
 
The output Light Transfer File will contain a header record, followed
by one record for each exposure level in the light transfer (or
reciprocity) sequence.
 
The AREA parameter may be used to specify the size fields of areas in
the image from which data is to be extracted.
 
The GRID keyword may be specified if a uniform grid of areas is desired.
The default grid consists of 100 areas spaced in a 10x10 grid pattern,
with each area 20x20 pixels in size.   The size of the input image
(800x800 for Galileo) is used to space these 100 areas uniformly
throughout the field of view.
 
The grid spacing and area size may be modified by using the GRES
parameter:
 
        Example:  GRES=(16,10,10) will create 256 areas in a 16x16 grid
                pattern, with each area 10x10 pixels in size.
 
At least one of the parameters AREA, GRID, or GRES must be used to
specify the areas.  These parameters may be used in combination,
so long as the total number of areas does not exceed 400.  However,
see note below.  Also, note that the AREA parameter should not be
used for reciprocity sequences since CCDRECIP requires a rectangular grid
pattern to determine line dependency for shutter offsets.
 
The EXPO parameter is used to specify the exposure levels of the light
transfer (or reciprocity) sequence.  The exposures should be specified
in ascending order, beginning with 0.0 for the dark current frame and ending
with the highest exposure in the sequence.  If, for Galileo, extended
exposure dark-current frames are also included in the sequence, then
they are entered first (as -1.0) followed by the normal dark-current
and the remaining exposures.
 
        Example:  EXPO=(-1.0,0.0,4.167,6.25,8.333,12.5)
 
The NI parameter specifies the maximum number of frames at any one
exposure level in the sequence.  This is necessary in order to ensure
that the exposure record is made large enough to hold the moments
for each input frame.
 
The LIST parameter contains the filename of the list of files for
which MOMGEN will be storing statistics.  The file must be a SRCH-format
file (see program SRCH) in which the files are sorted by increasing
exposure time.  LTGEN will read the labels of the files in
the list, extract the exposure times and derive NI automatically.
Therefore, if LIST is specified, EXPO and NI need not be used.

LTGEN will store the area size fields and exposures in the LTF file 
label.  The LTF will generate one place holder record for each exposure, 
which will be filled with moment information entered by MOMGEN.
 
Note that there is a VAX/VMS restriction on the maximum record size
of the LTF file (32,768 bytes).  This places a limit on the number of
specifiable areas which may be computed as follows:
 
   Let:  NAREA = the number of areas specified by the AREA and/or
                 GRID or GRES keywords.
         NI    = the maximum number of frames at a fixed exposure in the
                 light transfer sequence.
 
   Then: NS = 3*NAREA*NI+1 must not exceed 32768.
 
         NEXPO = the number of exposures (including dark current).
         NREC  = NEXPO
 
The following table gives the maximum number of areas specifiable for
each NI:
 
                     NI   GRES  NAREA  RECLEN(bytes)
 
                     1     20   400     4808

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 An image from the light transfer sequence. The image label
 is used to identify the output Light Transfer File.
.VARIABLE OUT
 The output Light Transfer File (LTF).  For details use HELP
 MOMGEN and TUTOR MOMGEN.
.VARAIABLE AREA
 INTEGER-OPTIONAL
 AREA=(SL1,SS1,NL1,NS1,SL2,SS2,NL2,NS2,...,SLn,SSn,NLn,NSn)
 specifying the size fields of up to 125 areas in the image.
.VARIABLE GRID
 KEYWORD-OPTIONAL
 Generates a 10x10 grid of areas uniformly distributed over
 the image to be used to produce the statistics in MOMGEN.
 Each area will be 20x20 in size. The resolution of this grid
 can be increased by using the GRES keyword.
.VARIABLE GRES
 INTEGER-OPTIONAL
 GRES=(N,NL,NS)
 Generates an NxN grid of areas uniformly distributed over the
 input image.  The areas are NLxNS pixels in size.  Data is extracted
 from these areas by MOMGEN and stored in the LTF.  Maximum N is 20.
 Default GRES=(10,20,20).
.VARIABLE EXPO
 REAL - (Required if LIST is not used)
 A string of floating point numbers specifying the commanded exposure times
 (in msec) of the light transfer sequence in ascending order.
 The first exposure is usually the dark current (0.0 msec):
        EXPO=(0.0,4.167,6.25,8.33,12.5,16.67)
 Galileo specific:
 If extended exposure frames are present in the sequence, then
 the sequence should begin with the extended-exposure dark-current
 (specified as -1.0 msec), followed by the normal DC, followed by the
 rest of the exposure levels:
        EXPO=(-1.0,0.0,4.167,6.25,8.33,12.5,16.67)
 However, sequences which consist entirely of extended-exposure mode
 frames should be treated as though they were normal exposure frames
 I.e., the extended-exposure dark-current should be specified as
 0.0 exposure, and later, when running CCDNOISE or CCDSLOPE, the EXTEXPO
 parameter should not be used.
.VARIABLE NI
 INTEGER - (Required if LIST is not used)
 Specifies the maximum number of frames at any one exposure level of
 the light transfer sequence.
.VARIABLE LIST
 STRING - Optional
 Specifies the name of a SRCH-format ASCII file containing a list of
 the filenames of all frames to be processed by MOMGEN.  The list must
 be in order of increasing exposure time.  LTGEN will automatically
 extract the exposure times from the VICAR labels and determine the
 proper value of NI.  This probably should not be used for the special
 case of extended-exposures for Galileo.
.VARIABLE DBUG
 KEYWORD
 Invokes special debug print.
