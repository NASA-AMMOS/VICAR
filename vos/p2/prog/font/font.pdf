VICAR2 program "font"--
       Writes text on an image allowing choices of FONT type, size and dn.
.HELP
PURPOSE:

"font" is a VICAR2 applications program which may be used to write text onto
any  VICAR2 byte image with a choice of seven available FONT styles.  Along
with  varying  the  FONT  style  the user can specify the height, width, dn
value  and  line  thickness  of each character and whether to left justify,
right  justify  or  center  the  text string above a specified point.  "font"
operates  in  a  completely  different  manner  than  "textad" and is no way
related.

.page 
EXECUTION STATEMENT:
		  font in out SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS) PARAMS
				    or
			    font in out PARMS

OPERATION:

"font" first  checks  the user entered parameters to insure that they are of
the  correct  format  and  number.   The  area  of  the input image that is
specified  by  the size field is copied from the input to the output image.
If  no  size field is specified, the entire input is copied to output.  The
input  image  is  closed and all subsequent work is performed on the output
image.   Due  to  the  fact that the various characters within a particular
FONT  have different sizes, it becomes extremely difficult to determine the
exact  dimensions  of  a text string.  (If exact text string dimensions and
character  positioning  are  required,  the user is encouraged to preform a
test  on  a  image  and  then  use IDISPLAY to measure the results.) If any
portion  of  a  text string is to written off the output image, the user is
notified  and  given  the  string number.  That portion of the string which
will  fit  in  the  output image is written and subsequent strings are then
processed.

EXAMPLES:
	font in out SIZE=(1,1,400,600) POSITION=(100,20,130,20) +
	     TEXT=("How goes it Laddy?","Just fine, Thanks!")
 
In  the  above  example,  both  text strings would be written in the output
image  with all six parameters being defaulted.  The results would have the
following  characteristics:  Both text strings, would be written in a Roman
style  FONT  (FONT=3),  the upper case letters are 15 pixels tall (tall=15)
and  12  pixels  wide (wide=.8,width is based on the height selected), both
upper  and lower case letters are allowed, the DN of the pixels in the text
is  255  (dn=255), the thickness of lines in the characters is 1 (thick=1),
and  the  starting  line  and  sample  coordinates given (POSITION(1,2) and
POSITION(3,4) indicated where the bottom left of the first character in the
text  strings TEXT(1,2) is to be written (loc=1).  The output data set will
be 400 lines by 600 samples.

      font in out SIZE=(100,100,300,500) POSITION=(300,20,350,20) +
	  TEXT=("How goes it Bobby?","None of your business.") +
			FONT=(11) TALL=(40)

The  example  above  illustrates  three  features  of program "font" that are
important to understand:

1) The size field determines the portion of the input data set that will be
copied  to  the  output  and consequently determines the size of the output
image.

2)  The  line  and sample coordinates given for text positioning (values in
POSITION(1,2)  POSITION(3,4))  are locations in the input image.  POSITIONs
are  always  related  to  the output image.  This means that the first text
string  TEXT(1) ("How goes it Bobby?") will start at line 200 and sample 20
in the output image.

3)  The  number  of values for the parameters TEXT, FONT, WIDE, THICK, etc.
need  not  match  exactly.   If  there are more TEXT strings than there are
values  for  FONT,  WIDE, THICK, etc., the last value given is used for all
remaining  strings.   Thus  in this example FONT=11 and TALL=40 is used for
both strings.

The program calls certain routines from txtsubs.com, from p2 library,
namely TXTTEXT, TXTFONT, TXTSIZE, TXTCOLOR, TXTROTATE.
It uses the font files located by the environment variable VRDIFONTS.

If VRDIFONTS not set or if it cannot find fonts it returns
-2 from status1 = TXTFONT(FONT1)

ERROR REPORTING
    Now reports error returns for certain internal routines


1 - TXTFONT - ??E txtfont return = n
    where, 
        n = 0 - function not implemented
        n = 2 - illegal font type (VRDIFONTS environment variable not set or fonts not found)
        n = 4 - font table too small
        n = 6 - end of file on font description file

2 - TXTSIZE - ??E txtsize return = n
    where,
        n = 0 - function not implemented
        n = 2 - Illegal height
        n = 4 - Illegal horizontal scale factor

3 - TXTROTATE - ??E txtrotate return = n
    where,
        n = 0 - function not implemented
        n = 2 - illegal angle

4 - TXTCOLOR - ??E txtcolor return = n
    where,
        n = 0 - function not implemented
        n = 2 - illegal color value
 
5 - TXTTEXT - ??E txttext return = n
    where,
        n = 0 - function not implemented
        n = 8 - Coordinates are outside access window
        n = 10 - Illegal LOC (orientation) value
        n = 12 - Illegal character count

COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER: R. J. Bambery

REVISIONS:
1.0 -- Original Version
2.0 -- Added ROTATE parameter and removed many restrictions
1995-01-02 V. Unruh (CRI) Made portable for UNIX
1996-07    HBM Fix handling of blanks within text
2008-08-21 R.J. Bambery - grabbed from VICAR V36 (Jun 27, 2007)
           Added error message support for txt calls
           (split off version for RJB)
2009-09-28 SRL  removed intial copy of the file to output, 
           then close and then ropen to update mode.
           Compressed files don't work in update mode. 
           Now it will Read, modify, write
           Add a call to xveaction so IO errors are reported
           It is still unreliable when using the size option
2010-02-14 R. J. Bambery - combined Aug 21, 2008 error handling
           with Steve Levoe's Sep 29, 2009 fixes, made 64-bit compliant
           with Linux, MacOSX/PowerPC and MacOSX/Intel
