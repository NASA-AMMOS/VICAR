!Generates  Capital M and little y images in a variety of conditions

!   font parameters 
!       position is bottom left corner of the first letter of the string
!       tall is height in pixels 
!       wide is % of height in pixels (if tall is 15 a wide of 0.8 is 12)
!       thick is thickness in pixels
!       font is font number
!
! Requires external test data: 
!   cartlab or mipl dependent pointers
!   
!   To facilitate this test you can define an
!   environment variable $AFIDS_TESTDATA to point to
!   that data. The cartlab system does not. In the git archive
!   on pistol there is softlink to the test data in vdev that
!   allows this test to pass
