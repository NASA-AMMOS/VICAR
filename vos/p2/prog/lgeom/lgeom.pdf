PURPOSE:
     LGEOM is a VICAR applications program which makes geometric
     changes in pictures.  It can be used for correcting geometric
     distortion, increasing picture size, and reducing picture
     size.  LGEOM should be used instead of MGEOM if any output
     line is rotated more than 85 degrees from its input position.
     It uses an intermediate data set which is created and deleted
     automatically, unless the entire input picture fits in memory.
     In this case, LGEOM operates in a one-pass mode.  Memory is 
     dynamically allocated with STACKA.
.page
EXECUTION:

     lgeom (INPUT,PDS) OUTPUT SIZE QUALIFIERS TIEPOINTS
WHERE
     INPUT          is the input data set.
     PDS            is an optional parameter and tiepoints dataset 
                      created by program MAP.  (Except for in MAP2,
                      LGEOM is almost always run with the PARMS parameter
                      as the means of entering the TIEPOINT, NAH, and NAV
                      parameters.)
     OUTPUT         is the output data set.
     SIZE           is a VICAR size field for the output set
     QUALIFIERS     consist of any of the following parameters
	  IDSNAM	indicates an alternative name for the
			itermediate data set (IDS)
	  IDSNS		indicates an alternative line size for IDS
          NOIN          indicates no interpolation is to be done
	  NOIZ		indicates no interpolation with zero DN values.
     TIEPOINTS      is a collection of parameters as follows:
	  NAH		The number of (tiepoint) rectangles in the horizontal
			direction (Number of areas horizontal)
	  NAV		The number of rectangles vertically.
	  TIEPOINT	A set of points mapping the rectangles in the
			output picture to quadrilaterals in the input
			picture.  For details, see help under the
			TIEPOINT parameter.
           or
	  PARMS		An optional parameter data set (equivalent to
                        PDS, but in the new VAX format).  
                        LGEOM is almost always run with the PARMS parameter
                        as the means of entering the TIEPOINT, NAH, and NAV
                        parameters.

Tiepoint rectangles need not be defined for the entire picture.
If an area of the picture is not within a defined rectangle, it is geomed 
using parameters from the nearest defined rectangle. Thus, in order to have 
a portion of the input picture reproduced exactly in the output, it is 
necessary to define a rectangle with zero displacement around the area.

If the output picture does not fill the area reserved for it by the
SIZE parameter, the pixels in the unfilled area are given the value zero. 
If the size field is defaulted, the output picture will be the same size as 
the input picture.

The default mode for LGEOM is four-point bi-linear interpolation;
i.e. the output pixels will be a function of the DN values of the four
points in the input picture closest to the fractional line and sample
calculated by the specified transformation.

The input image may either be byte or halfword data.  The data format is taken
from the VICAR label of the input file.  The output image has the same data 
format (byte or halfword) as the input image.  

The size field parameters refer to samples, 
even for halfword data.  For example, the following
will enlarge a 100 line by 100 sample (200 bytes) halfword data set A to 216 
lines by 150 samples (300 bytes).
	lgeom A B SIZE=(1,1,216,150) NAH=1 NAV=1 +
	 TIEPOINT=(1,1,1,1, 1,100,1,150, 100,1,216,1, 100,100,216,150)

The keyword NOIN can be used to specify no interpolation. In this
case the DN value of the point closest to the fractional line and sample
is used. This method (sometimes referred to as "nearest neighbor") is
somewhat faster, but is not as accurate as the four point interpolation.

The keyword NOIZ can be used to specify no interpolation with DN values of
zero.  This is used when zero represents missing data and you do not want
to interpolate at the boundary of good data and missing data.

LGEOM may accept parameters from disk as a second input file. 
This is the method used in the MAP2 procedure.  The format
of this disk data set is a single record consisting of NP+1 words, where
NP is the number of words of actual parameters and the first word contains
NP. This is an optional data set.

The common usages of LGEOM are within procedures such as MAP2 and MAPTRANS,
or following such programs as PICREG, RG, TIECONM, or TIEPARM.  TIEPARM, for
example, could be used to convert tiepoints in an IBIS interface file into
a VICAR PARMS file that could be entered as the PARMS parameter in the
LGEOM command line.

EXAMPLE

tieconm OUT=TIEPARMS 'LGEOM NAH=40 NAV=40 +
          MINL=1.,MINS=1.,MAXL=3000.,MAXS=3000.+
          TIEPOIN=(1,1,1,1, 1,3000,1,10, 3000,1,10,1, 3000.29,3000,10,10) 
lgeom LGTEST LGENLARG SIZE=(1,1,3000,3000) PARMS=TIEPARMS

     In this example,  the tiepoints are used to set up a 3000
     x  3000 grid for use by LGEOM.   The tiepoints given to TIECONM
     can  be scattered  over  the  image  in  any  fashion   whereas 
     LGEOM requires a regular grid.
.page
LIMITATIONS:

  A. When a second input dataset is used to enter the rectangles (MAP),
     a maximum of 400 rectangles can be used.  When the TIEPOINT or PARMS
     parameter is used, the number of rectangles is unlimited.  However,
     the TAE maximum count of 32767 limits the number of rectangles to 8192.

  B. The maximum number of samples per line in the output file is 32767.

  C. Since STACKA is used to allocate memory, the maximum picture size
     is unlimited.  When very large pictures are used, the page file quota
     must be large enough to accomodate a buffer used to map the blocks
     in the Intermediate Data Set.  The number of bytes in this buffer is
     6 times the estimated number of blocks in the Intermediate Data Set.
     (The RATIO parameter can be used to change the estimated number of
     blocks.)

  D. The output tiepoint coordinates must be whole numbers.  Users rarely
     need to know of this restriction since the TIEPOINT parameter is
     usually generated by another VICAR program.  Users only need to be
     concerned about this if they are actually entering specific values
     for the TIEPOINT parameter for the LGEOM command line.

RECORD SIZE OF INTERMEDIATE DATA SET FOR LGEOM (IDSNS):

The optimum size of the intermediate data set (IDS) for LGEOM is a
function of the number of rectangles, input and output sizes, and the
available buffer space.

In general, the IDS record length should decrease as the number of pixels
in the output file increases.  The number of lines needed for IDS is 
calculated inside the program.

.VARI TIEPOINT
Specifies mapping of control
points between output and

.VARI PARMS
Parameter data set name
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Input file name.  This parameter is input as
     INP=in
where
in       is the input file name.

In addition, a second file may be specified which contains the
line and sample (tiepoint) parameters.  If this second file is specified,
the parameter would then be 
     INP=(in,pds)
where
PDS is the name of a program-MAP-type parameter data set.
Note : The second input file (pds) is used only in conjunction with  
program MAP.  

LGEOM is almost always run with the PARMS parameter
as the means of entering the TIEPOINT, NAH, and NAV parameters.
.VARI SIZE
The size field is specified with four arguments,
     SIZE=(a,b,c,d)
where:
a is the starting line number of the output picture.
b is the starting sample of the output picture.
c is the number of lines, and
d is the number of samples
For example, SIZE=(1,1,40,50)
would create an output picture of size 40 lines by 50 samples.
.VARI SL
Usually defaulted (SL=1).
SL tells the program where in the output coordinate system to start the
output image.  The output coordinate system is the system used for
all (newline,newsample) coordinates in the TIEPOINT parameter.
.VARI SS
Usually defaulted (SS=1).
SS tells the program where in the output coordinate system to start the
output image.  The output coordinate system is the system used for
all (newline,newsample) coordinates in the TIEPOINT parameter.
.VARI NL
NL can be used in conjunction with NS in place of the SIZE
parameter to specify the size of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of lines for output.
.VARI NS
NS can be used in conjunction with NS in place of the SIZE
parameter to specify the size of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of samples per line for output.
.VARI IDSNAM
IDSNAM is an optional parameter which can be used to specify the
name of the intermediate data set.  This is often used to change the
location of the data set.  This data set is usually slightly larger than
the output file, but may be up to 2 times as large in some cases.

For example, if the user's current directory is USERDISK:[USER],
and he/she does not have enough disk space for IDS, then he/she could
input IDSNAM=SCX:[USER]LGIDS or some such name to ensure that
the IDS ends up in a valid directory with enough disk space to hold it.

On VMS systems the user may define a DCL logical name of LGIDS to
avoid having to specify the parameter repeatedly.  For example, if
before running the LGEOM job the user inputs

DCL DEFINE LGIDS SCX:[USER]LGIDS

then all subsequent lgeom jobs would point to that Intermediate data
set until the logical name was deassigned (DCL DEASS LGIDS).
.VARI IDSNS
 IDSNS is an optional parameter which may be used to change the number
 of bytes per line in the Intermediate Data Set.  The main purpose
 of this parameter is to allow the user to "tune" LGEOM to obtain the
 optimum speed.  (The value should gradually decrease from its default 
 value of 1000 when NL or NS get large and the working set is small.)  

 The program may change the value of IDSNS if it is necessary for avoiding
 aborting execution due to insufficient memory.
.VARI PMEM
Physical memory (megabytes) available for LGEOM dynamically allocated buffers.
This applies to non-VMS systems only.  The default is 16.0.  (The maximum value
is 2047 (megabytes), to insure that the number of bytes can be stored as a
32-bit integer.)

This parameter can usually be defaulted.  If the amount of memory available
is less than the default, then PMEM should be set accordingly to prevent the
program from thrashing.  If the amount of memory available
is more than the default, then PMEM may be set accordingly to allow larger
images to be handled in one pass.
.VARI RATIO
RATIO is used to estimate the number of blocks in the Intermediate
Data Set and allocate a memory buffer to map the blocks. The default
value of 2.0 should cover all but very unusual cases.  RATIO is the factor
by which the Intermediate Data Set exceeds the Output Data Set.
.VARI WSA
WSA is an optional parameter to reduce the working set size that LGEOM
automatically determines.  The default value is 150,000 bytes to allow
for I/O buffers etc.
.VARI INTERP
NOIN means no interpolation.  The default method for computing the
DN values of the output picture is to use a bi-linear interpolation
on the four nearest neighbors in the input picture.  With NOIN, the
value of the nearest point is simply used.
For example, say a point in the output picture was determined
to have come from point (R,P) in the input picture.  Since R and P
are real values, we must somehow calculate a DN value for that
point.  Take IR and IP as the truncated values.  We then have
          VAL1                                 VAL2
           *                                    *
         (IR,IP)                              (IR,IP+1)
                     POINT
                       *
                     (R,P)
          VAL3                                 VAL4
           *                                    *
         (IR+1,IP)                           (IR+1,IP+1)
Here, POINT is the result of a bilinear interpolation using
VAL1, VAL2, VAL3, and VAL4.
If NOIN is specified, then POINT would be VAL1, the nearest
neighbor.
.VARI INTRPZ
NOIZ means no interpolation with zero DN values.  Whenever an interpolation
is to be done and one of the points is zero, nearest neighbor is used.
This option is used when zero represents missing data and you do not want
to interpolate between good data and missing data.
.VARIABLE PRINT
 Causes a listing of the TIEPOINT parameters to be generated and causes
 periodic progress messages to be printed 
 (Default is that no such listing is printed.)
.VARI FORMAT
The format is obtained from the input image label. 
.VARI NAH
NAH=N where N is an integer value specifing the number of areas horizontally;
which is also the number of columns of tiepoints less 1. NAH must
be specified unless an optional dataset containing the parameters NAH, NAV
and TIEPOINTs is specified. (2nd optional input dataset if the dataset is 
created by program MAP, optional parameter dataset (see PARMS parameter) if the
dataset is created by any other program besides program MAP).
NAH must also be >= 1.
.VARI NAV
NAV=N where N is an integer value specifing the number of areas vertically;
which is also the number of rows of tiepoints less 1. NAV must be specified
unless an optional dataset containing the parameters NAH, NAV, and TIEPOINTs
is specified (2nd optional input dataset if the dataset is created by program
MAP, optional parameter dataset (see PARMS parameter) if the dataset is created
by any other program besides program MAP).  NAV must also be >= 1. 
.VARI TIEPOINT
TIEPOINT=(newline(1),newsamp(1),oldline(1),oldsamp(1),newline(2),...). The
values of TIEPOINT specify the mapping of control points between output
and input pictures.  The numbers which follow the keyword are in multiples
of four, one multiple of four for each tiepoint. The numbers may be either
integer or real type. However since the grid in the output must be 
rectangular, the (newline,newsamp) points must be whole numbers.  The
total number of tiepoint numbers must be
			4*(NAH+1)*(NAV+1)
Within each group of four numbers describing a tiepoint, the first number
specifies the line coordinate of that tiepoint in the output (transformed)
picture, the second number specifies the sample coordinate of that tiepoint
in the output picture, the third number specifies the line coordinate of the
input picture and the fourth specifies the sample coordinate of the input
picture. The order in which the tiepoints are specified is left to right
within a horizontal row of tiepoints. The horizontal rows of tiepoints are
specified in top-to-bottom sequence. Tiepoint specification is further
clarified in the OPERATIONS and TIMING sections.  The TIEPOINT parameter
must be given unless an optional dataset containing the NAH, NAV, and
TIEPOINT parameters is specified.(2nd optional input dataset if the dataset
is generated by program MAP, optional parameter data set (see PARMS parameter) 
if the dataset is generated by any other program besides program MAP ).
.VARI PARMS
PARMS can be used to specify the name of an optional parameter data 
set.  Any combination of the allowable parameters may be given.  If
any of the parameters are given interactively, the interactive value
takes precedence.

LGEOM is almost always run with the PARMS parameter
as the means of entering the TIEPOINT, NAH, and NAV parameters.
This parameter names a VICAR PARMS file, (xvpopen type for you programmers.)

Note: If the data set is generated by program MAP, it has to be entered as
a second input instead of PARMS.
