PURPOSE

    POLYPMAP converts coordinates for the specified map projection between
latitude-longitude space and line-sample space.

The following projections are currently implemented:

  Mercator					'MERCATOR
  Lambert Two-Standard Conformal Conic		'LAMBERT
  Cylindrical (Normal)				'CYLINDRI
  Simple Cylindrical (Rectangular)		'RECTANGU
  Polar Stereographic				'POLSTERE
  Oblique Stereographic 			'STEREOGR
  Polar Orthographic				'POLORTHO
  Oblique Orthographic 				'ORTHOGRA
  Oblique Simple Cylindrical 			'OBLICYL
  Sinusoidal Equal Area Projection  		'SINUSOID 
  Oblique Sinusoidal                            'OBSINUSO
  Mollweide                                     'MOLLWEID
  Transverse Mercator                           'TMERCATO

     The MIPL subroutine CONVEV (TRANV) is used to perform the map projections.
     POLYPMAP does not support "image space" or "object space".
     The results of the ported POLYPMAP  differ from the unported POLYPMAP
     in a few cases; (see under Precision and Accuracy).

EXECUTION

			PLANET=body              SCALE=pixel scale      +
			LATITUDE=special lat     LONGITUD=special long   +

			LATRANGE=(minlat,maxlat) LONRANGE=(minlon,maxlon) +
			SKIP=nominal data



    The map projection, the planet, and the scale must be specified.
    The MODE keyword is used to indicate the direction of the transformation;
the default is latitude-longitude to line-sample; use 'INVERSE for line-samp
to lat-long.
    The 'AUTOMAT keyword will cause the special line and sample to be
calculated so that latitudes and longitudes inside the LATRANGE,
LONRANGE box will project to a desired location.   'AUTO placement 
can only be used for a forward transformation.

NOTE: All latitudes and longitudes are in degrees, and all 
	longitudes are in West degrees (0 to 360).




    Projection Scaling
	In all map projections there is at least one point at which the scale
	of the projection equals the scale on the sphere. The scale at such
	points, in km/pixel, determines the size of the input picture in the
	output area. For the Mercator projection, scale is correct everywhere
	on the equator. For the Lambert, it is valid all along both standard
	parallels. For the Orthographic and Stereographic it is valid at the
	center of projection. (See also under Help for parameter PROJ.)

PRECISION AND ACCURACY

The unported POLYPMAP used a local version of the SUBLIB routine TRANV to do
coordinate transformations.  The ported POLYPMAP uses the SUBLIB routine 
CONVEV instead.  The change was made for the following reasons:
1) The local version of TRANV was ten years behind the SUBLIB version.  It was
   missing several corrections and several projection types.  Instead of
   using routine MERCPATCH for Mercator projections, this version of TRANV
   had one line commented out;  this appeared to be an inadequate substitute
   for MERCPATCH, giving different results.  There was nothing comparable
   to routine RECTPATCH in the local version of TRANV.
2) The use of local variants of SUBLIB routines makes VICAR maintenance more
   difficult.
3) Jean Lorre and Lucas Kamp said that TRANV was not intended for direct calls
   from application programs but was intended to be accessed via subroutine
   CONVEV.  

The results from the ported POLYPMAP differ from the unported POLYPMAP in
the following cases:
a) Mercator projection:  Because of the code differences described in 1) above,
   differences such as the following occur:
   Input lat,lon:       -60.73      -45.21
   Output line,samp
    from ported pgm     -24.04       51.33
   Output line,samp
    from unported pgm    86.65       51.33

b) Oblique simple cylindrical projection: The unported local version on TRANV
   appears to be in error, failing to convert THR1 to east longitude for the
   calculation of OLAMBDA.  The final equation for computing SAMPLE appears to
   be different.
   Differences such as the following occur:
   Input lat,lon:       -60.73      -45.21
   Output line,samp
    from ported pgm     -76.53     -134.44
   Output line,samp
    from unported pgm   -76.53      -54.67
c) Sinusoidal projection:  The computations in the ported TRANV have been
   overhauled, resulting in minor differences such as the following: 
   Input lat,lon:       -60.73      -45.21
   Output line,samp
    from ported pgm      -9.30       25.58
   Output line,samp
    from unported pgm    -9.44       25.69

.VARIABLE PROJ
Each possible projection type is described below.
 'MERCATOR specifies a Mercator projection. 
 This projection  maps the sphere, except for the two poles, onto a 
 strip on the plane.  The width of the strip is equal to the scaled
 circumference of the  planet at the equator.  It extends infinitely
 in both vertical  directions.  Longitude lines project to the
 infinitely long, vertical straight lines which are equally spaced.
 Latitude circles become horizontal line segments whose spacing
 increases without limit as  you approach the pole.  The Mercator is a
 conformal projection (scale  errors at any point are equal in all
 directions, so shapes of small  areas are preserved).  
    The MERCator projection works somewhat differently than before the
 port to UNIX:
        LINE      The line in the output to which LATITUDE will project.
                  Defaults to 1.0.

                  Defaults to 1.0.
        LATITUDE  The latitude of LINE in the output.
                  Default computes latitude to center input in output.
        LONGITUDE The longitude of SAMPLE in the output.
                  Default computes longitude to center input in output.


.PAGE
 'LAMBERT specifies a Two-Standard Lambert Conformal Conic
 projection. In  this projection two latitude parallels on the same
 side of the equator  are chosen as "standard".  There will be no
 scale error any where on  these parallels.  In addition, some
 longitude is chosen as "central".  The projection is developed on a
 cone which intersects the planet at  the standard parallels.  This
 cone is cut along the meridian 180 degrees  away from the central
 meridian.  The result is that the sphere is mapped onto the region
 between two semi-infinite rays emanating from the projection of the
 pole in the same hemisphere as the standard parallels.  The opposite
 pole is the only point on the sphere which is not mapped.  Longitude
 meridians become semi-infinite rays emanating from the visible
 pole, but not at their true angle since all longitudes are confined
 to lie between the two outermost rays, each of which  represent the
 meridian along which the cone was cut.  The central meridian is the
 only vertical line among the longitude meridians.  Latitude circles
 become circular arcs centered on the projected pole and confined
 between the outer longitude meridians.  The longitude rays are
 equally spaced.  The latitude circles are too widely spaced outside 
 the standards and too closely spaced between them.  The spacing of
 the  latitude circles increases without limit as you approach the
 opposite pole.  As its name inmplies, this projection is conformal.
 Neither the  Mercator nor the Lambert are true perspective projections. 
	PARAL1 and PARAL2 are the latitudes of the standard parallels.
	The LONGITUD parameter specifies the central meridian.
	The line origin is the pole.
	The sample origin is central meridian.

.PAGE
 'CYLINDRI requests the cylindrical (normal) projection. 
 This projection maps the sphere onto a strip on the plane.  The width 
 of the strip is equal to the scaled circumference of the planet at 
 the equator.  Longitude lines project to vertical lines which are
 equally spaced and extend from one pole to the other.  Latitude
 circles become horizontal lines whose spacing varies as the cosine
 of the latitude.  The cylindrical projection is an equal area
 projection.  
	The LATITUDE parameter specifies the line origin.
	The LONGITUD parameter specifies the sample origin.

.PAGE
 'RECTANGU requests the Simple Cylindrical (Rectangular) projection.
 This projection is similar to the Normal Cylindrical except that
 the spacing of the latitude circles (horizontal lines) is constant
 with and is equal to the spacing of the longitude lines.  
	The LATITUDE parameter specifies the line origin.
	The LONGITUD parameter specifies the sample origin.

.PAGE
 'POLSTERE requests an Polar Stereographic projection. 
 The stereographic is true perspective projection.  The projection plane 
 is tangent to the planet at the pole.  Perspective lines emanate from 
 the other pole.  Thus the entire sphere except for one point is mapped 
 to the entire plane.  Longitude meridians are  straight lines intersecting
 at the pole at their correct angles.  Latitude circles project to complete 
 circles centered on the pole.  The projection is conformal.  Features are 
 expanded  more and more without limit as you move away from the center of 
 projection.
	The LONGITUD parameter specifies the meridian that is in the
	    "up" direction in the line-sample space.
	The POLE parameter specifies which pole.

.PAGE
 'STEREOGR requests an Oblique Stereographic projection. 
 The stereographic is true perspective projection.  A plane is placed  
 tangent to the sphere at the center of projection.  Perspective lines  
 emanate from the point on the sphere diametrically opposite from the
 center of projection.  Thus the entire sphere except for one point is  
 mapped to the entire plane.  Longitude lines and latitude circles  
 project to ellipses whose spacing and orientation vary in a  
 complicated way.  The projection is conformal.  Features are expanded  
 more and more without limit as you move away from the center of projection.
	The LATITUDE and LONGITUD parameters specify the center of
	    projection (i.e. the point on the planet directly below
	    perspective point).
	The NORTHANG parameter specifies the orientation of the projection.
	The line origin is the center of projection. 
	The sample origin is the center of projection. 

.PAGE
 'POLORTHO requests an Polar Orthographic projection. 
 This is a true perspective projection with perspective point at 
 infinity.  The projection plane is tangent to the planet at the pole.  
 Longitude meridians are  straight lines intersectiong at the pole at 
 their correct angles.  Latitude circles project to complete circles 
 centered on the pole.  The hemisphere centered at the pole is mapped 
 to a circle on the plane of radius Req.  Features are compressed 
 relative to their true scale as you move away from the pole.  No point 
 in the other hemisphere can be projected. 
	The LONGITUD parameter specifies the meridian that is in the
	    "up" direction in the line-sample space.
	The POLE parameter specifies which pole.

.PAGE
 'ORTHOGRA requests an Oblique Orthographic projection. 
 This is a true perspective projection with perspective point at 
 infinity.  The projection plane is tangent to the planet at the center 
 of projection.  Perspective lines are parallel to each other,
 perpendicular to the  projection plane.  Thus one hemisphere centered
 at the center of  projection is mapped to a circle on the plane of
 radius Req.  Longitude  meridians and latitude circles map to
 ellipses.  Features are compressed relative to their true scale as
 you move away from the center of projection.  No point more than 90
 degrees away from the center can be  projected.  This projection is
 frequently used by space projects because it makes the input frame
 appear much as it would from the spacecraft if it were directly
 above the center of projection.
	The LATITUDE and LONGITUD parameters specify the center of
	    projection (i.e. the point on the planet directly below
	    perspective point).
	The NORTHANG parameter specifies the orientation of the projection.
	The line origin is the center of projection. 
	The sample origin is the center of projection. 
.PAGE

 'OBLICYL requests an Oblique Simple Cylindrical projection. 
 The scale is correct along the oblique equator.
	The LATITUDE and LONGITUD parameters specify the center of
	    projection 
	The NORTHANG parameter specifies the orientation of the projection.
	The line origin is the center of projection. 
	The sample origin is the center of projection. 

.PAGE

 'SINUSOID requests a Sinusoidal Equal Area Projection of the authalic sphere.
 Latitude parallels are equally space in the line direction.  Longitude
 meridians are sinusoidal lines, except for the central meridian which is a
 straight vertical line.  The latitude scale is correct everywhere, and the
 longitude scale is correct along the central meridian.  Distortion 
 increases away from the central meridian.

	The LONGITUD parameter specifies the central meridian.
	The line origin is the equator (latitude = 0).
	The sample origin is the central meridian.

.PAGE
 'OBSINUSO requests Oblique sinusoidal projection. Same as sinusoidal except
 the sphere can be rotated before the projection is performed.
        LINE specifies the location of latitude=0,  
        SAMP specifies that of longitude=180.
        LATI and LONG specify the position of the North pole.  
        PARAL1 is the longitude to which LONG will move.

.PAGE 
 'MOLLWEID requests the mollweid projection. Equal area. Latitudes are
 straight parallel lines. Longitudes converge on the poles. Scale is true
 at latitudes +/- 40 deg 44 min.
        LINE      The output line of latitude 0.
                  Defaults to the center of the output.
        SAMPLE    The output sample of the reference longitude 
                  specified by LONGITUDE.
                  Defaults to the center of the output.
        LATITUDE  not used.
        LONGITUDE The REFERENCE longitude for the projection.
                  Will be a vertical line in the output.
                  Defaults to the center of the input.
        SCALE     The scale in km/pixel at latitude 40 deg 44 min N or S.

.PAGE
 'TMERCATO requests the Transverse mercator projection. Same as Mercator
 except the central meridian is substituted for the equator, permitting both
 poles to be seen. Central meridian, other meridians 90 degrees distant,
 and the equator are straight lines.
        LINE      The output line of the latitude specified by LATITUDE.
                  Defaults to the center of the output.
        SAMPLE    The output sample of the reference longitude 
                  specified by LONGITUDE.
                  Defaults to the center of the output.
        LATITUDE  The latitude placed at LINE in the output.
                  Defaults to the center of the input.
        LONGITUDE The REFERENCE longitude for the projection
                  ( That longitude which maps to a vertical line ).
                  Defaults to the center of the input.
        SCALE     The scale in km/pixel at central meridian.

.VARIABLE SCALE
 SCALE represents the scale, in km/pixel, at the undistorted (see under PROJ)
 part of the projection.  

.VARIABLE LINE
 The LINE parameter specifies the translation of the line-sample space
 in the line direction.  LINE is the line coordinate of the line origin.
 (E.g. for a Lambert projection the pole has a line coordinate given
 by the LINE parameter).
 In AUTO placement mode the LINE parameter specifies the minimum output 
 line of the region.

.VARIABLE SAMPLE
 The SAMPLE parameter specifies the translation of the line-sample space
 in the sample direction.  SAMPLE is the sample coordinate of the sample
 origin.  (E.g. for a Lambert projection the central meridian has a sample
 coordinate given by the SAMPLE parameter).
 In AUTO placement mode the SAMPLE parameter specifies the minimum output 
 sample of the region.

.VARIABLE LATITUDE
 The LATITUDE parameter specifies the special latitude.  See the help
 for the PROJ parameter on the particular use of the parameter for the
 desired map projection.

.VARIABLE LONGITUD
 The LONGITUD parameter specifies the special longitude. See the help
 for the PROJ parameter on the particular use of the parameter for the
 desired map projection.

.VARIABLE PARAL1
 PARAL1 and PARAL2 are used mainly for the Lambert projection.  They are
 the latitudes of the two standard parallels which define the projection.
 This parameter is also used to specify the special longitude in the
 Oblique projections.
.VARIABLE PARAL2
 PARAL2 is used only for the Lambert projection.  They are
 the latitudes of the two standard parallels which define the projection.

.VARIABLE NORTHANG
 NORTHANG is used only for Oblique Stereographic, Oblique Orthographic,
 and Oblique Cylindrical projections.  NORTHANG is the angle in degrees 
 of north in the output space.  This angle is measured in the projection 
 plane at the center of projection clockwise from up. 

.VARIABLE POLE
 POLE is only used for the Polar Orthographic and Polar Stereographic
 projections.  POLE specifies the pole visible in the projection, either
 NORTH or SOUTH.

.VARIABLE PLACEMEN
 PLACEMEN is a keyword the specifies the placement of the lat-long
 in the line-sample space.  The default is for the placement to
 depend on the LINE and SAMPLE parameters.   'AUTOMAT will cause the 
 special line and sample to be calculated so that latitudes and 
 longitudes inside the LATRANGE, LONRANGE box will project to only 
 positive line and samples.   'AUTO placement can only be used for 
 a forward transformation.

.VARIABLE LATRANGE
 LATRANGE specifies the minimum and maximum latitude of the box to be
 used in the 'AUTO placement mode.

.VARIABLE LONRANGE
 LONRANGE specifies the minimum and maximum longitude of the box to be
 used in the 'AUTO placement mode.

.VARIABLE SKIP
 The number of nominal data values to skip over in the graphics-1 file.
 These data values are carried along to the output graphics file
 without modification.
