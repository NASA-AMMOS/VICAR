PURPOSE

     "picmatch"  is a batch oriented image correlation routine 
     which incorporates the following features.

     1. Correlation  of  image  to image.

     2. Sampling  of one image to match the geometry of  the 
        other  image (e.g.  one image could be at  different 
        scale or rotation).

     3. Regular or phase correlation in the FFT domain.

     4. Specification of a magnification factor to correlate 
        a larger area without increasing computation.

     5. Use  of  a geometric model to estimate the  matching 
        locations  and  feedback of matches  to  refine  the 
        geometric model.

     6. Matching of images along a polygonal contour.

     7. Use  of  standard  data formats for  all  input  and 
        output data sets.

                         contains  the  pairs  of   matching  
                         coordinate locations together  with
                         editing information  such as corre-
			 lation value.  


OPERATION

     First,  "picmatch" sets up a geometric model relating the 
     two images using the ITIE-OTIE parameters.   The points 
     originally  given  are supplemented  by  matches  which 
     exceed  the  value given by the parameter MINCORR  or  its 
     default.   The  geometric  model is used to estimate  a 
     search  location  and to specify a  resampling  of  the 
     first  image to match the raster gridding of the second 
     image.   The model is a linear least squares fit to the 
     control  points.   For normal image to image  matching, 
     only  ITIE-OTIE  points  are  needed.   Their  accuracy 
     should be sufficient to yield a match within the search 
     area  specified  by parameters SEARCH and  MSEARCH  taking 
     into account nonlinearities in the data.

     The  second step is to set up the correlation point set 
     in  the second image by one of three methods.   If  the 
     parameters MINL,  MINS, MAXL, MAXS, NAH, NAV are given, 
     then a grid of points will be used.   If a third  input 
     (a contour or point set) and the parameter CONTOUR is used 
     then the correlation point set will be spaced along the 
     contour  (see  the CONTOUR parameter).   By  specifying  a 
     large spacing, the input can be regarded as a point set 
     and  matching  will  only  occur at the  nodes  of  the 
     contour.

     The  iteration  over  the  correlation  point  set  now 
     proceeds.   At the requested point in the second input, 
     a  32x32  sub-image is extracted.   If the point  is  a 
     fractional pixel location,  the center of extraction is 
     moved   to   align   with  pixel   spacing   to   avoid 
     interpolation.   In fact, interpolation will occur only 
     if  the keyword MAGNIFY is used with a nonintegral  value.  
     The  geometric  model  is used to  calculate  a  search 
     location in the first input.   If this is a  fractional 
     pixel  location,  then  it is also aligned  with  pixel 
     spacing  to minimize interpolation near the center.   A 
     sub-image is extracted of size WxW where W is somewhere 
     between  the values given by the parameters SEARCH  and 
     MSEARCH.  This  sub-image  is  extracted  by   bilinear 
     interpolation at a rotation and pixel size to match the 
     second  input  geometry as specified by  the  geometric 
     model discussed earlier.

     Correlation is performed on 32x32 subwindows of the WxW 
     window.   The  32x32 pieces of the two inputs are  each 
     subjected   to  a  complex  valued  DFT  via  the   FFT 
     algorithm.  One of the DFT arrays has its low frequency 
     terms  set  to  zero by zeroing the first row  and  the 
     first  column unless the parameter NOHPF is  specified.  
     Then  the DFT's are multiplied element by element  (one 
     DFT is conjugated).  If PHASE=1 is specified each
     product is divided  by the  absolute value of its multi-
     plicands (to give phase correlation,  see  reference  1).   
     ("picmatch" divides each element of the FFT of the 
     cross-correlation by the amplitude of the element raised 
     to the PHASE power.  See under the PHASE parameter.)
     Except for phase correlation the power in each FFT is calculated
     for use in the normalization.  An inverse  FFT  is applied  
     to  this  result and the peak  and  its  eight neighbors 
     are saved.   The correlation value for both methods is 
     normalized so that the maximum possible correlation value 
     is 1.0 .   The subwindow is moved over  the search  
     area  with an increment of at most  12  pixels.   When  
     the  entire search area is covered,  the  largest peak is 
     taken to be the correlation point.  A final FFT correlation 
     is performed at the correlation peak to get a refined 
     correlation.   Unless NOSUBPIX is specified a subpixel 
     match is  obtained by  fitting a quadratic  to the peak  
     and  its  eight neighbors.     The match point is transformed 
     back to  the original image location  via  the  inverse  
     of   the geometric  model  and  incorporating  alignment  
     shifts performed in both images.  

     The results are written to an IBIS interface (tabular)
     file with one row for each tiepoint.  The following 
     column format is used:

     Column       Description			   Format

        1     First input matching line            real*4
        2     First input matching sample          real*4
        3     Second input line                    real*4
        4     Second input sample                  real*4
	5     First input estimated line           real*4
	6     First input estimated sample         real*4
        7     First input Z value                  real*4
        8     Second input Z value                 real*4
        9     Correlation value                    real*4
       10     Sequence number                      real*4

       11,12  Latitude of chip                     real*8
       13,14  Longitude of chip                    real*8

    The last four columns are only output if the ground control 
    chip set option is invoked; if so the second input line and 
    sample refer to the reference point in the ground control chip.




    Information about each matching point is printed out unless 
    the NOPRINT keyword is specified.   The printed information
    is as follows:

        1   SEQ			Sequence number
	2   SECOND LOCATION	Tiepoint location in second image
	3   ESTIMATED LOCATION	Estimated location in first image
	4   FIRST LOCATION	Matching location in first image
				    (from correlation search)
	5   CORREL		Correlation value (between 0 and 1)
	6   WIN			Current search window size
	7   RESID		Residual distance (between estimated 
				    location and correlation location)
	8   FN			Failure number

     If correlation  fails,  nothing  is written into the  disk 
     file  but  a failure number is given  in  the  printout 
     under the column heading FN.  The failure numbers are:

              1             point on edge of second image 
				(more than ten percent of chip off image)
              2             failure of RETRY option to exceed threshold
              4             correlation peak unreliable
              5             subpixel correlation failure


     Points  completely outside of either image are  ignored 
     completely.




PRECISION

Due to the iterative nature of the subroutine llsq, the programs results will
vary from machine to machine.  When prnt in llsq's test program was temporarily
changed to a write statement, it was observed that the resulting output varied
from machine to machine.  The following table will provide some idea of the
differential between machines.

                              input    image   to    control

                              geometry.   
.VARIABLE OTIE
     OTIE=(P1,Q1,...,PN,QN)   This specifies the  correspon
                              ding  control  points  in  the 
                              second  image.   If the second

                              The number of values given  to

                              by R (default 1.0).   The grid 
                              is  always  32 by 32  so  this 
                              increases the correlation area 
                              without increasing computation.

			      fied separately for line and 
			      sample directions.
.VARIABLE SEARCH
     SEARCH=S                 This specifies that the search 
                              area  in  the first  input  is 
                              initially  an SxS  square  re-
                              gion.   Allow  for uncertainty 
                              and  nonlinearity in the esti-
                              mation of matching location by 
                              ITIE,  OTIE and add 12 more to 
                              S for ineffectiveness of  cor-
                              relation near the window edge.  
                              S  must be less than or  equal 
                              to   128  which  is  also  the 
                              default.
.VARIABLE MSEARCH
     MSEARCH=T                This   specifies   that    the 
                              initial   search   S  can   be 
                              reduced    upon     successful 
                              matching to a minimum value of 
                              T.    Note   that   successful 
                              matches  refine  the image  to 
                              image geometric model allowing 
                              a  reduction in search with  a 
                              consequent     savings      of 
                              computation.     The   default 
                              value  is 50 and miminum value 
                              is 32.
.VARIABLE MINCORR
     MINCORR=V                The  value  V sets  a  minimum 
                              correlation     value      for 
                              acceptance of a new point into 
                              the  image-to-image  geometric 
                              model (default .20).

.VARIABLE ZWIND
     ZWIND=W                  The program calculates and outputs
			      the  average brightness values 
			      at  the matching coordinates.  
			      The average is calculated using
			      a W by W window.  Default is 10.
.VARIABLE ZREJECT
     ZREJECT=(K,Z)            The average brightness is rejected 
			      by setting the output Z value to
			      -999 if more than  K of  the values 
			      are below a DN value of Z.  This
			      does not affect whether the corre-
			      lation is performed.  The default
			      is (100000,0) .

.VARIABLE MINL
     MINL=M1,MINS=M2,         These  specify a set  of  grid 
     MAXL=M3,MAXS=M4,         locations  in the second input 
     NAH=M5,NAV=M6            image  for  correlation.   The 
                              program      will      attempt 
                              (M5+1)*(M6+1) correlations  in 
                              a  uniform grid bounded by the 
                              values M1,...,M4.  This is  an 
                              alternative  to matching along 
                              a set of points specified by a 
                              third input data set.
.VARIABLE CONTOUR
     CONTOUR=(A,B)            This parameter must be given  if 
                              a  third data set containing a 
                              contour   or  point  set   for 
                              matching is given.   The third 
			      data set is in graphics-1 format.
                              The  parameter A  specifies  a 
                              spacing  to be followed  along 
                              the   contour.    The  routine 
                              always   matches  at   contour 
                              nodes  hence a  large  spacing 
                              turns  the third input into  a 
                              simple   set  of  points   for 
                              matching.   The parameter B is 
                              normally 0 (zero) but if it is 
                              set  to 1 then it reverses the 
                              role of ITIE and  OTIE.   This 
                              is   a  convenience  when  two 
                              images  are  correlated  twice 
                              along contours in each of  the 
                              frames.

.VARIABLE STOP
     STOP=(N,T)               This  instructs the program to 
			      stop after achieving N matches
			      with a correlation value above
			      a threshold T.  This is useful
			      for saving CPU time while still
			      assuring a certain number of
			      good matches.

.VARIABLE RETRY
     RETRY=(N,T,R)            This  instructs the program to 
                              attempt  more  tries  near   a 
                              location    if    a    certain 
                              correlation  threshold is  not 
                              achieved.   N is the number of 
                              tries  (1 to 5), with the first
			      try being the at the original point.
			      T is  the correlation threshold 
			      required to stop the retry at each  
			      point.  A failure number is 
 			      printed every time the threshold 
			      test fails.  If all retries for 
			      a point fail then nothing is 
			      written to the output files.
                              The  retry pattern is to  move 
                              to  the corners of a square 
			      i.e. to move to (+/-R, +/-R) from
			      the original point.

.VARIABLE PHASE
       PHASE=P		      P is a REAL*4 value in the 
			      range 0 to 1.  

                              Use          PHASE=1
                              for          phase correlation.

                              Use          PHASE=0
                              for          normal (NOPHASE) correlation.

			      "picmatch" divides each element of the
			      FFT of the cross-correlation 
			      by the amplitude of the element raised 
			      to the P power.  Note that when
			      P is 0, this reduces to 
			      dividing by 1.  (The value of the
			      correlation is still normalized
			      to a maximum possible value of 1.)
                              "picmatch" runs slower for PHASE values 
			      other than 0, .5, and 1.
			      The default for P is 1.
			      (See also the help for subroutine CROSSCORR.)
.VARIABLE FILTER
       FILTER=P		      This parameter specifies the
			      power of the power law filter
			      that can be applied in the FFT
			      domain for the correlations.
			      The filter enhances the high
			      spatial frequencies relative 
			      to the low ones, thus helping
			      the correlation key in on edges.
			      The radial power law filter 
			      multiplies both of the FFT's.
			      The filtering is not recommended 
			      for the phase (PHASE=1) corre-
			      lation.  Default is P=0.
			      
.VARIABLE NOPRINT
        'NOPRINT	      This specifies that the normal 
			      printout is to be suppressed.  
			      Error messages will still be
			      printed. 

.VARIABLE NOHPF
       'NOHPF                 This   specifies   that    the 
                              default  high  pass filter  in 
                              the correlation is to be  shut 
                              off.   The  high  pass  filter 
                              consists  of zeroing the  low-
                              order  row  and column of  the 
                              DFT matrices.

.VARIABLE NOSUBPIX
         'NOSUBPIX            This  specifies that  subpixel 
                              correlation   is  not  to   be 
                              calculated (see operation)

.VARIABLE NOCORR
         'NOCORR              This  turns off correlation so 
                              that the estimated points  are 
                              taken   to  be  the   matching 
                              location.  It  is  useful  for 
                              generating  certain  kinds  of 
                              output data sets.
