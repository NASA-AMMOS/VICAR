.TITLE
VICAR program jpegfix

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Jpegfix smoothes edges in images in order to reduce the patchiness introduced
by severe jpeg data compression. It will not affect small features.

EXECUTION:
jpegfix inp=in out=out

NOTES:
1. The image must reside in memory (limited to 2,000,000 pixels).
2. The image is converted to HALF format internally.
3. The algorith is effective with data compressions above about 30:1.
4. The algorithm is ineffective on ICT compression images such as used by 
   Galileo.

METHOD:
Pixels are compared in groups of 4 pixels along lines and columns independently.
If 4 consecutive pixels are labelled I1,I2,I3,I4 then if:
I2 > I1 and I2-I1 <= THRESH and I3 > I2 and I4 > I3 then:
I2=(I2+I3)/2 and I3=(I3+I4)/2

This logic is performed both positively (as above) and negatively along
 both rows and columns in both directions for ITER times each.
