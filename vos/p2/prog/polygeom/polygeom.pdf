PURPOSE

   polygeom  performs geometric transformations to correct  for 
   distortion  and  increase or decrease the size  of  a  point 
   polygon  data  set.   The inverse transformation allows  the 
   polygon  data  set to be transformed back  to  its  original 
   state.  polygeom is similar in format and function to GEOMA.  
   The transformed image is subdivided into a series of quadri-
   laterals.   As  in  GEOMA,  the user specifies a mapping  of 
   points  from an input image to an output  image.   Within  a   
   quadrilateral,  the  program transforms polygon points  from    
   the input image to an output image.   The control points are   
   specified  arbitrarily  without  restriction  to  the  image 
   borders.   As  in  GEOMA,  two  of the four  control  points 
   forming  corners  of any given quadrilateral  may  coincide, 
   causing the quadrilateral to degenerate into a triangle.
   Control  points are specified by line-sample coordinates  in 
   the  input  and output picture.   The internal algorithm  of 
   polygeom  is similar to GEOMA except that polygon data  sets 
   can be transfromed much more rapidly than images.   As  with 
   GEOMA, polygeom will accept its control parameters on a data 
   set  instead  of  or in addition to the  conventional  VICAR 
   parameters.   The main differences between polygeom and  the 
   other  transformative routines is that it basically operates 
   on  line defining polygons and not photo  images.   Thus  no 
   interpolation of data values is required.  polygeom also has 
   the  added capability of inverse transfrormation.   This  is 
   discussed further in the Operation section.   Since polygeom 
   follows the format of GEOMA,  much of the document is simply 
   a repeat of earlier documentation of GEOMA by J.  B. Seidman 
   dated May 16, 1974.

OPERATION

   polygeom  transforms the coordinate definitions of  polygons 
   using three or four coefficients of transformation depending 
   on the description in the parameter file.  First the program 
   must  decide  which  coefficient to  apply.   For  this  the 
   program  must decide which quadrilateral area in the  output 
   picture the pixel lies.   Using the subroutine  INSIDE,  the 
   containing  quadrilateral is selected.   The  transformation 
   equation  is formed in the following manner.   Let the coor-   
   dinates  of  the four control points defining  that  quadri-     
   lateral     in     the    output    picture    be     called 
   [x(j),y(j),j=1,2,3,4],  and in the input picture let them be 
   called  [x'(j),y'(j),j=1,2,3,4].   (x may be considered  the 
   line  coordinate and y the sample,  although they  could  as 
   well be reversed for this discussion.)  The values of all 16 
   of  these  numbers  are part of the control  parameters  for 
   polygeom.
   Define a transformation by

                        x' = ax+by+cxy+d
                                                         (1)
                        y' = ex+fy+gxy+h

   where  the values of the coefficients a,b,...,h  are  deter-    
   mined by requiring that

                 x'(j) = ax(j)+by(j)+cx(j)y(j)+d
                                                         (2)
                 y'(j) = ex(j)+fy(j)+gx(j)y(j)+h

                 for j = 1,2,3,4

   This  is  the  condition  that  the  defined  transformation 
   exactly  maps the control point coordinates as specified  by 
   the parameters.
   The  transformation  is  used to transform  the  line-sample 
   coordinates  of the polygon point being processed  into  its 
   corresponding  coordinates in the output picture.  The input 
   and  output  coordinates are defined as four  byte  floating 
   numbers defining a polygon boundary.  In this case the pixel 
   position  is not interpreted,  the value is either there  or 
   not.

   In  order  for  polygeom to  work  properly,  the  tiepoint 
   coordinates  in  the  output picture  must  satisfy  certain 
   constraints.   They  must be organizable into a  rectangular 
   matrix of points.  That is, each tiepoint must belong to one 
   row  and one column of points,  each row must have the  same 
   number  of points as every other row,  and each column  must 
   have  the same number as every other column.   It should  be 
   possible to number the rows sequentially from top to bottom, 
   and the columns from left to right.   Quadrilaterals used by 
   the program for performing the geometric transformation  are 
   formed by connecting each tiepoint to the adjacent tiepoints 
   in the same column and in the same row.
     These  quadrilaterals  should all have the  property  that 
   they are not concave (no interior angle of any quadrilateral 
   should be greater than 180o). The number of areas vertically 
   is the number of rows of tiepoints less 1, and the number of 
   areas  horizontally  is the number of columns  of  tiepoints 
   less 1.
   Although  the  transformation in equation (1) is  very  well 
   behaved within the quadrilateral in which it applies,  there 
   is  no  assurance that it is continuous across the  boundary 
   between  adjacent  quadrilaterals;  unless the  boundary  is 
   precisely  vertical or horizontal.   The degree  of  discon-     
   tinuity   depends   on   the   details   of   the   tiepoint 
   specifications.   In some cases the discontinuity may be  so 
   small  that  the transformed picture has no visible  defect, 
   but in others it may be quite visible.

   The user has two choices to eliminate the discontinuity.  He  
   may  specify a rectilinear grid of output tiepoints,  or  he 
   may  specify tiepoints in such a way that the quadrilaterals 
   degenerate into triangles.  A quadrilateral degenerates into 
   a  triangle if two adjacent tiepoints defining it  have  the 
   same coordinates.  By suitable choice of tiepoints, the user 
   can   specify  the  coordinates  in  such  a  way  that  all 
   quadrilaterals degenerate into triangles.  Figure 2  shows a 
   sample array of tiepoints satisfying this  condition.   When 
   an  area is a triangle,  the cross terms in equation (1) are 
   eliminated and the transformation becomes

                        x' = ax+by+d
                                                         (3)
                        y' = ex+fy+h

   where  the  values  of the coefficients  are  determined  by 
   requiring that

                    x'(j) = ax(j)+by(j)+d

                    y'(j) = ex(j)+fy(j)+h                (4)

                    for j = 1,2,3

   The  values  of  j designate the  three  distinct  tiepoints 
   defining the triangle.   Because equation (4) is linear, the 
   transformation  is  guaranteed  to  be  continuous  at   the 
   triangle   boundaries  and  discontinuities  in  the  output 
   picture cannot occur.

   There  is a question about how to transform picture  samples 
   which  fall  outside  all  the  quadrilaterals  defined   by 
   parameters.   One  answer  is  to avoid  this  situation  by 
   specifying  the control point locations so that every sample 
   in the output picture falls within some quadrilateral.
   This  requires  that some control points fall exactly on  or 
   outside  the border of the output picture.   The program  is 
   not affected in any way by using control points outside  the 
   picture.

   If   some  picture  samples  do  fall  outside  the  defined 
   quadrilaterals, the program will process each such sample by 
   assigning  it to a nearby quadrilateral.   This is  done  by 
   "extending"  the boundaries of all "edge" quadrilaterals  to 
   the  picture  borders.   If the point falls in  two  polygon 
   extensions,  the  closest quadrilateral is selected based on 
   the distance of the point to the nearest center of an edge.
.PAGE
   The  user  should understand that the algorithm can lead  to 
   discontinuities  in  the processed picture  in  the  regions 
   outside  the defined quadrilaterals,  even when the  control 
   areas are triangles.
   The  method of calculating the inverse transformation is  as 
   follows.   the  forward  transformation F is assumed  to  be 
   nearly  linear.   A  linear  approximation  A  is  found  by 
   dropping the XY term from F.  Given a point p,

                      p' = Fp = Ap + C

   then
                         -1      -1
                    p = F  p' = A  (p'-C)

.PAGE
   Given  an  input  point q (in the output image  raster)  its 
   inverse point is calculated by iteration.

                          p1 = q-C

                              -1
                 P    = P  - A  (Fp -q)
                  n+1    n         n

   Convergence  is  tested  by examining  the  Fp -q  term  and 
                                                 n
   usually occurs within three iterations.

   The  method relies upon the fact that Fp -q is the error and 
                                           n
.PAGE
          -1                                 
   since F   is nearly linear, the correction is:
                    -1            -1
                  -F  (Fp -q) = -A  (Fp -q)
                         n             n

TIMING

   A   polygon   data  set  consisting  of  38000  points   was 
   transformed   in   about   four   minutes.     An    inverse 
   transformation might be several times slower.

.VARIABLE     SKIP
         SKIP=n             This is used for skipping nominal

.VARIABLE     IGNORE
              IGNORE=(x,y)  This  causes all occurrences of the 
                            point (x,y) to be left as is.   The 
                            default  is  to  ignore  the  point

                            equation  is found in an  iterative 
                            process   which  approximates   the 
                            transformation   equation  used  to 
                            create the output file,  applies it 
                            to the original points,  and  tests 
                            the approximated points against the 
                            output  control points.   The  dif-     
                            ference  is  transformed  backwards 
                            and  subtracted  from the  previous 
                            point.   Through  this process  the 
                            error is reduced.   When the  error 
                            is   reduced  to  nearly  zero  the 
                            solution   is    accepted.     This 
                            iterative   process  is  relatively 
                            efficient,   converging  the  three 
                            steps for most cases.  (For further 
                            explanation   see   the   Operation 
                            section.)
