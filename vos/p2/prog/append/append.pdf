.HELP
PURPOSE:
APPEND accepts up to thirty data sets and writes them out, one after
another, as a single data set.

EXECUTION:

Example
	APPEND INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D    will write A, B, and C out to D.

Size and parameter fields are not used.

Note:  APPEND outputs the total number of lines and samples written;
if input images are of varying data types, the "number of samples written"
will be the maximum number of samples of all the inputs. If real input 
is mixed with integer, the data type of the output will be real.

OPERATION:
After opening all the inputs, APPEND computes the size of the output 
data set. It will choose the format of the largest data type, where
the order (largest to smallest) is: COMP, DOUB, REAL, FULL, HALF,
and BYTE.  Each input is then copied into the output data set, in the 
same order as specified in the command.  If the inputs are of varying 
sample length, the output lines are padded with zeroes on the end.  
All output lines are of the same length, the length of the longest 
input line(maximum # of samples x largest format).
	Note that APPEND does not copy over any binary labels.

Currently BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, DOUB, and COMP formats are supported.

REVISIONS: 
 Number of input images increased to 30 -- BAM --  26 Nov. 1984.

 In mixed case, chooses largest type now instead of smallest. -SVH 20 July 1994
 Switched from FORTRAN to C -- SVH -- 20 July 1994
 Added capability for DOUB and COMP data types. -- SVH -- 20 July 1994

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input image files
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output image file
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the input data sets.  Up to thirty are allowed.
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT specifies the output data set.  The number of lines in the output will 
be the sum of the number of lines in all the inputs.  The number of samples 
will be the maximum of the number of samples of all the inputs.  The format
of the output will the the format of the largest input data type.
