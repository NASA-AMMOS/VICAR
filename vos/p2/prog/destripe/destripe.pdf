PURPOSE
    A vicar application program to remove striping in images caused by
variations in detector response. 

OPERATION

    This program removeds stripe or banding artifacts in images do to  
variations in the response of the detector. This is especially
useful for pushbroom sensors.

    Internally, the program averages rows or columns.

    The WINDOW parameter allows you to select a rectangular window in
the image to do the averaging. The adjustment is applied to all
rows or columns in the image. Otherwise, the entire image is scanned.

    Choose orient=vert when stripes appear in vertical (columnar)
direction and chose orient=horiz (sample or rowwise) direction.
The output image has the banding or striping removed.


INTERNALS

    The internal data is stored in real*4 format. Stacka is called
to allocate the internal buffers. It is limited to 536,200,000 full 
words (2,144,800,000 bytes), which is an image of about
15320x35000 or 21000x25000 in lines and samples.

    The program always lets you know the memory it uses for stacka
by the message, e.g.,
 memory allocated =     262144, 
which is in full words.

RESTRICTIONS

    1) This program does not work on DOUB images.
    2) This program does not work on multiband images
    3) The image is limited to nl and ns equal to 536,200,000 fullwords
        (2,144,800,000 bytes)
