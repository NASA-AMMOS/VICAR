PURPOSE

   "ibislsq2" performs least squares fits on data in an IBIS interface
(tabular) file.  The solutions and/or residuals can be placed in 
specified columns of the file.  The solutions can also be output
to the terminal.  Multiple fits can be done on different parts of
one file.


EXECUTION

     ibislsq2 INP=DATA.INT  INDCOL=(1,2,3) DEPCOL=4 CONCOL=7 +
	     RESCOL=8  COEFFCOL=(21,22,23) 'NOPRINT

    This example shows the use of all of the parameters.  The input
file, DATA.INT, is an IBIS interface file.  The data for the independent
variables are in columns (1,2,3), and the data for the dependent 
variables are in column 4.  The control column 7 is used for
multiple fits to be done in one run.  The least square fits are done 
on sets of rows; a new set is started whenever the value in the control 
column changes.  If no control column is specified then one fit
is done on the whole file.  The COEFFCOL and RESCOL parameters specify
in which columns, of the input file, the results will be put.  If either
or both are not specified then they will not be output.  There must be
as many coefficient columns as there are independent columns and these
match the sequence of the independent variable columns.  The
coefficients of the solution are placed in columns 21,22,23.  The
residual column can be used to easily calculate the deviation of the
data points from the fitted line. Normally the solution for each set
is printed to the terminal, but this can be turned off with the
'NOPRINT keyword.  

    The length of each set should, of course, be longer than the
number of independent variables (columns).  If it is not then the
least squares fit will not be called and values of -999.0 will be
put out for the solution.  If some columns of the independent data
are dependent then the error MATRIX RANK TOO SMALL be be printed,
and -999.0's will be put out for the solution.  If there is no
solution then zeros will be put out for the residuals.



EXAMPLES

   Suppose that columns 1 and 2 contain points (x,y) in a plane 
   and  column  7 contains a function  f(x,y).   The  following 
   sequence  will perform a quadratic least squares fit  h(x,y) 
   and place the residuals in column 8.

RESTRICTIONS

The maximum number of independent columns (variables) is 20.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
   INP=file           Input IBIS interface file
.VARIABLE INDCOL
   INDCOL=(N1,...,Nk) The   integers   N1,...,Nk  specify   the 
                      columns  which contain the data  for  the 
                      independent variables.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE DEPCOL
   DEPCOL=M1          The integer M1  specifies   the columns
                      which contain the data  for  the 
                      dependent variable.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE COEFFCOL
   COEFFCOL=(N1,...,Nk) The   integers   N1,...,Nk  specify   the 
                      columns  which will receive the coefficients
                      of the solution for use in applying to
                      other operations in the IBIS file (for example
                      a slope or trend of some data points can be
                      found and the slope can be applied to other
                      data).  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.
		      
		      Note that there is a lot of repetition of the
		      coefficients in the columns, but this allows
		      the coefficients to be used in a row-oriented
		      arithmetic operation by routine MF.

.VARIABLE RESCOL
   RESCOL=R1          The  integer R1 specifies the  column which 
                      will  receive the residuals corresponding 
		      to the dependent variables for each data
		      point.  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.
.VARIABLE CONCOL
   CONCOL=C           The integer C specifies a control column 
                      which produces a separate fit for each 
                      group of identical numbers in the control 
                      column.  If this keyword is omitted, then 
                      the whole file is DGELGd in one least 
                      squares fit.
.VARIABLE NOPRINT
    'NOPRINT	      Keyword to suppress printout of solution.
