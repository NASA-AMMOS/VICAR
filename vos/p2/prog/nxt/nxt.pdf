Returns data for next file in a SRCH list
.HELP

OPERATION

NXT reads a list file which was written by the program SRCH and 
returns information about the next file in the list.  The values 
are returned in ONAM, ISTAPE, TAPEPOS, and NXTFIL.  Upon completion, ONAM
contains the name of the disk file or tape position which is next in the list.

If the file is a tape, ISTAPE will be 1, otherwise it will be 0.

If ISTAPE is 1, then TAPEPOS will contain the file position number on 
the tape.

NXTFIL contains the (ordinal) number of the returned file within the list file.

NXT needs to have write access to the input file and to its directory because
it modifies the first record of the file.  The recommended method for accessing
a SRCH file owned by another user is to make a copy of it in one's account.


HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE

This program was written for processing files from a 9-track tape on
a VAX-VMS system in the 1980's. In those days disk space was limited,
so tape was the medium of archival storage and data interchange.

Tapes came in two forms; with and without IBM standard labels. Standard
label tape allowed file names to be associated with a position on the
tape. If the tape was not labeled then you could only access data
by knowing its position on the tape. This program performed this
function for you by relating an entry in an ascii text list of files
to a position on a tape and then creating a disk file with a filename.

The example, below shows historically how this was done under VAX-VMS.

Now this program gives you the ability to access files quickly from
a list, thus avoiding a human manual entry.

EXAMPLE:

The following procedure could be used to get a list of the 
system label of each file in the list file LIST.DAT.

PROCEDURE
  LOCAL FILENAM TYPE=STRING
  LOCAL ISTAPE TYPE=INT
  LOCAL POSITION TYPE=INT
  LOCAL FILENUM TYPE=INT
BODY
  RESET LIST.DAT
  write ('resetting')
  LOOP
    NXT LIST.DAT FILENAM ISTAPE POSITION FILENUM
    IF (FILENAM = "END_OF_FILE") BREAK
    IF (ISTAPE)
        ALLOC MT T
	MOUNT T COMMENT="Please mount tape &FILENAM"
	LABEL-LIST &FILENAM/&POSITION 'SYS
      ELSE
        LABEL-LIST &FILENAM 'SYS
    END-IF
  END-LOOP

REVISIONS:

  1986-09    SP  Changed fscanf to sscanf and changed                  
                 format specifier from "%5d" to "10%d"                 
                 to allow users to modify the first record in file.    
                 Added code to check for first record having a         
                 different length than expected and to handle this.    
                 Modified to output to a TAE variable the number of the
                 file (as done in program CNT) per Charlie Avis.       
                 Note that this change the calling sequence of NXT by  
                 adding another required parameter, NXTFIL.            
  1987-02    SP  Added code to handle  NO RECORDS in SRCH file.        
  1994-06    SVH Ported to UNIX - Steve Hwan				
  1996-06    OAM Included a REWIND statement and a loop in the VMS part
	         to avoid dropping filenames as it updates the NEXT FILE
                 number.  FR 89371.
  1997-08    RRD Added first fseek call after #else (the UNIX specific 
                 section) because a previous call to fscanf had moved 
                 the current position in the file and this fixes it.
  1998-07    TIH Changed constant value with FILENAME_LEN to fix       
  2011-10    LWK Increased pool size in q_init call from 500 to 1000   
                 to fix V-block overflow in 64-bit linux.             
  2012-12-09 RJB fixed warnings with gcc 4.7.2         
                 moved variables c and ounit into #ifdef VMS_OS block   
  2012-12-14 RJB Doc update.
  2016-03-07 WLB Switched to ANSI_C. Removed VMS residue. Migrated to MIPL.
  2019-06-13 WLB IDS-7922: Initialized some variables.
                 IDS-7924: Switched to constant formatting string.
		 IDS-7925: Null-terminated some strings.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INPUT 
List file
.VARI ONAM
Output -- the next name
in the list
.VARI ISTAPE
Output -- TRUE (1) if tape
.VARI TAPEPOS
Output -- File position number 
.vari nxtfil
Output -- Number of next
file in list.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INPUT
The input file which was generated by the program SRCH.  The file
contains a list of file names from which the next entry is to be
selected.
.VARI ONAM
After exiting NXT, the parameter name given for ONAM contains
the next filename in the list contained in INPUT.  If the file
is on a tape, then ONAM contains the name of the tape.

See the example under HELP NXT.
.VARI ISTAPE
ISTAPE is an output integer from NXT which is 1 (logical TRUE) if
the file given in ONAM is a tape, and 0 (logical FALSE) if it is not.

ISTAPE may be used like a logical expression in TCL, like

  IF (ISTAPE) ...

See the example under HELP NXT.
.VARI TAPEPOS
TAPEPOS indicates the file number on the tape when the output from
ONAM is a tape file (ISTAPE is 1).

See the example under HELP NXT.
.vari nxtfil
Upon completion of NXT, the parameter given for NXTFIL contains the
number of the next file to be referenced in the INPUT list (corresponding
to ONAM).
