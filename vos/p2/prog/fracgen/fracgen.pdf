.TITLE
Simulates elevation data via fractional brownian motion
.HELP
PURPOSE:

fracgen generates images which are similar to elevation images of mountainous
regions using the fractional Brownian motion process.

EXECUTION:

fracgen  fake.img NL=300 NS=150  FORMAT=HALF +
	 FRACDIM=2.30 POWER=2.0 SEED=32161267

This example, which uses all the parameters, generates a 128x128 image that has
a fractal dimension of 2.30 and starts the random number generator with that
particular seed.  The fractal dimension parameter governs the roughness of the
terrain:  try values between 2.0 and 2.5, the default is 2.15.  The elevations
are raised to the POWER power.  If the power is greater than one this has the
effect of smoothing out the valleys relative to the mountains.  Using a partic-
ular value for the SEED parameter allows the generation of the same terrain.
If the SEED is defaulted, a random value is used for the seed.  

fracgen fake.img

This example will generate a 256x256 image with fractal dimension 2.15.


OPERATION:

fracgen basically just filters white noise with a power law filter.  More
specifically it generates random phases and random amplitudes, multiplies
the amplitudes by a power law ( 1/f**(power),  f is frequency), and FFT's
them to get the fake elevation image.  The elevations are raised to the POWER
power and are scaled to fit into the format.  Because an FFT must be
performed this program can take a large amount of CPU time.

NOTE:

fracgen creates a large (roughly 8000 blocks) temporary scratch file named
by the user but defaulted to fracgen.scr.  The file is automatically deleted 
on successful completion of the program.

RESTRICTIONS:

The maximum image size is 4096 in either direction.

                          Changed destination of temporary scratch file to
                          V2$SCRATCH.

			  Changed file specification so that it can be set

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image
.VARIABLE NS
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NL
Number of samples
.VARIABLE FORMAT
The output format
.VARIABLE FRACDIM
The fractal dimension
.VARIABLE POWER
The exponent the elevation
is raised to.
.VARIABLE SEED
The random generator seed
.VARIABLE IDSNAM
Name of Intermediate Data Set
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE OUT
The output file name
.VARIABLE NS
NS can be used in conjunction with NL in place of the SIZE
parameter to specify the size of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of samples per line for output.
.VARIABLE NL
NL can be used in conjunction with NS in place of the SIZE
parameter to specify the size of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of lines for output.
.VARIABLE FORMAT
The FORMAT parameter is defaulted to BYTE
.VARIABLE FRACDIM
The FRACDIM parameter is the fractal dimension parameter chosen to 
determine the roughness of a given terrain.  The default value is 
2.15.
.VARIABLE POWER
The POWER parameter is used to smooth out valleys relative to mountains
for a certain terrain.  The default value is 1.0.
.VARIABLE SEED
Using a particular value for the SEED parameter allows the generation of 
the same terrain.  If the SEED is defaulted, a random value is used for 
the seed.
.VARIABLE IDSNAM
IDSNAM is an optional parameter which can be used to specify the
name of the intermediate data set.  This is often used to change the
location of the data set.  This data set is usually slightly larger than
the output file, but may be up to 2 times as large in some cases.

For example, if the user's current directory is USERDISK:[USER],
and he/she does not have enough disk space for IDS, then he/she could
input IDSNAM="fracgen_scr" or some such name to ensure that
the IDS ends up in a valid directory with enough disk space to hold it.
