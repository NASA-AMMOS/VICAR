PURPOSE
-------

PIXGRAD calculates the magnitude (slope) and direction (azimuth)
of the gradient at each pixel within an image.  The image of slope
values is saved in the first output dataset, and the azimuth image
is sent to the second output.

The gradients are computed by examining the four adjacent pixels
(left, right, above, below) to the point being evaluated.  From these
pairs of points, a line-direction and a sample-direction gradient is
computed. The composite slope and azimuth are computed by a
trigonometric summation of these two gradients.

Prior to rescaling, the slope is computed as degrees from horizontal,
while the azimuth is degrees East of North.  The default rescaling
maps the slope values to 0 DN for horizontal and 255 DN for vertical.
The default azimuth rescaling places North at 0 DN, East at 64 DN,
South at 128 DN, and West at 192 DN.

Additionally, the user may output the x and y derivatives which
are part of the dip and amimuth computations. By indicating two
additional output data sets, the program will automatically 
output these values.  Scale parameters are available so that the
floating point numbers computed for the x and y derivatives fit
nicely into the halfword output value. 

A subset version of the program is available by indicating the
CENTER keyword.  The program will output the center pixel of a 
moving 9 square box.  In essence, the program will choose pixel
2,5,8,...from rows 2,5,8,...etc.

.VARIABLE METHOD

            Method for computing delta-x and delta-y

    PIXGRAD calculates the magnitude of the gradient of an image from
    estimated partials delta_x and delta_y. By default PIXGRAD computes 
    the delta_x and delta_y by the following algorithm using a
    3 x 3 pixel window around point e:

          a   b  c             METHOD #1 (default):
          d   e  f         delta_x(e) =  (d - f)/ 2
          g   h  j         delta_y(e) =  (b - h)/ 2 

.page
    The new parameter METHOD allows for more precise computations
    using the following:

    Note: North and West facing gradients are positive.

      First-order ERDAS method:

           delta_x = [(c + f + j) - (a + d + g)] / 6 
           delta_y = [(g + h + j) - (a + b + c)] / 6 

      Second-order ARCINFO method:

           delta_x = [(c + 2*f + j) - (a + 2*d + g)] / 8 * x_scale
           delta_y = [(g + 2*h + j) - (a + 2*b + c)] / 8 * x_scale
.page
     From the deltas the "dip" angle of the normal vector, and its
     azimuthal orientation with respect to north  is computed by:

          z = sqrt ( (delta_x**2) + (delta_y**2) )

          dip angle =  ATAN(SQRT(z))
          azimuth   =  ATAN2(-delta_x, delta_4) MOD 2*PI
.VARIABLE LSCALE
             Line scale in miles per line.

             Default = 0.01
.VARIABLE SSCALE
             Sample scale in miles per sample.
             Default = 0.01
.VARIABLE AALT
             Altitude scale in feet per dn of input.

             Default = 1.0 feet/dn
.VARIABLE CENTER
	If present,  subsampled output data sets will be generated.
