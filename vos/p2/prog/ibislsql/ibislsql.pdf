.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "ibislsql"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   "ibislsql" performs least squares fits on data in an IBIS interface
(tabular) file.  The solutions and/or residuals can be placed in 
specified columns of the file.  The solutions can also be output
to the terminal.  Multiple fits can be done on different parts of
one file.  A threshold can also be specified so that the program
will repeatedly perform least sqares fitting while throwing out
outliers until all the residuals are under the defined  threshold.  
It first performs a "global" least squares fitting by using all
a grouped dataset.  (Datasets are grouped by the values in CONCOL.)
For all datapoints that have residuals greater than the threshold,
it will obtain 30 closest datapoints and perform a "local" least
squares fitting.  If the local residual is still greater than
the threshold then the datapoint is thrown away.  If not, it is
kept.

Note that if only x' is specified, the outlier will
be determined by the data point's residual value.  If both x' and
y' are specified then the outlier will be determined by
square root of (residual(x')^2 + residual(y')^2).

EXECUTION

     ibislsql INP=DATA.INT OUT=DATAOUT INDCOL=(1,2,3) DEPCOL=4
             CONCOL=7 RESCOL=8  COEFFCOL=(21,22,23) DEPCOL2=5
             RESCOL2=8 COEFFCOL2=(24,25,26) 'NOPRINT THRESH=2.0

    This example shows the use of all of the parameters.  The input
file, DATA.INT, is an IBIS interface file and the output file
is also an IBIS interface file.  The data for the independent
variables are in columns (1,2,3), and the data for the dependent 
variables are in column 4 and 5.  The control column 7 is used for
multiple fits to be done in one run.  The least square fits are done 
on sets of rows; a new set is started whenever the value in the control 
column changes.  If no control column is specified then one fit
is done on the whole file.  The COEFFCOL and RESCOL parameters specify
in which columns, of the input file, the results will be put.  If either
or both are not specified then they will not be output.  The COEFFCOL2
and RESCOL2 correspond to the DEPCOL2 data.  There must be
as many coefficient columns as there are independent columns and these
match the sequence of the independent variable columns.  The
coefficients of the solution are placed in columns 21,22,23.  The
residual column can be used to easily calculate the deviation of the
data points from the fitted line. Normally the solution for each set
is printed to the terminal, but this can be turned off with the
'NOPRINT keyword.  

    The length of each set should, of course, be longer than the
number of independent variables (columns).  If it is not then the
least squares fit will not be called and values of -999.0 will be
put out for the solution.  If some columns of the independent data
are dependent then the error MATRIX RANK TOO SMALL be be printed,
and -999.0's will be put out for the solution.  If there is no
solution then zeros will be put out for the residuals.

EXAMPLES

   Suppose that columns 1 and 2 contain points (x,y) in a plane 
   and  column  7 contains a function  f(x,y).   The  following 
   sequence  will perform a quadratic least squares fit  h(x,y) 
   and place the residuals in column 8.

   mf INP=A FUNCTION=("C3=C1*C1","C4=C2*C2","C5=C1*C2","C6=1")
   ibislsql INP=A OUT=B INDCOL=(1,2,3,4,5,6) DEPCOL=7 RESCOL=8

   Suppose that you want the program to automatically take out
   outliers one at a time and reperform least squares fitting.
   To repeat until all residuals are below 2.0:

   ibislsql INP=A OUT=B INDCOL=(1,2,3,4,5,6) DEPCOL=7 RESCOL=8
      THRESH=2.0

   Suppose now that columns 1, 2, and 3 represent the independent
   variables, columns 4 and 5 represent x' and y' respectively,
   column 7 represents the control column, 8 and 9 represents
   the residual columns for x' and y' respectively, columns 10,
   11, 12 represents the coefficients to the solution to x',
   and columns 16, 17, 18 represents the coefficients to
   y'.  Suppose also that we would like the solution to have the
   maximum residual for any data point to be below 2.0 and
   we want to not print the solution to the screen.  The
   following command performs this task:

   ibislsql inp=a out=b indcol=(1,2,3) depcol=4 depcol2=5 +
      colcol=7 rescol=8 rescol2=9 coeffcol=(10,11,12) +
      coeffcol2=(16,17,18) thresh=2.0 'NOPRINT

RESTRICTIONS

The maximum number of independent columns (variables) is 20.
DEPCOL, COEFFCOL, and RESCOL corresponds to each other and
DEPCOL2, COEFFCOL2, and RESCOL2 corresponds to each other.
You can not mix them together... for example, you can not
have DEPCOL correspond to RESCOL2.

.VARIABLE OUT
   OUT=file           Output IBIS interface file containing the
                      solution.

.VARIABLE INDCOL
   INDCOL=(N1,...,Nk) The   integers   N1,...,Nk  specify   the 
                      columns  which contain the data  for  the 
                      independent variables.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE DEPCOL
   DEPCOL=M1          The integer M1  specifies   the columns
                      which contain the data  for  the 
                      dependent variable.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE DEPCOL2
   DEPCOL=M2          The integer M2 specifies the second column
                      which contains the data for the second
                      dependent variable set.  Each row contains
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE COEFFCOL
   COEFFCOL=(N1,...,Nk) The   integers   N1,...,Nk  specify   the 
                      columns  which will receive the coefficients
                      of the solution for use in applying to
                      other operations in the IBIS file (for example
                      a slope or trend of some data points can be
                      found and the slope can be applied to other
                      data).  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.
		      
		      Note that there is a lot of repetition of the
		      coefficients in the columns, but this allows
		      the coefficients to be used in a row-oriented
		      arithmetic operation by routine MF.

.VARIABLE COEFFCOL2
   COEFFCOL=(I1,...,IK) The integers I1,...,Ik specify the
                      columns which will receive the coefficients
                      of the solution corresponding to the
                      DEPCOL2 variable.  If this parameter is
                      omitted then no residuals for the second
                      solution will be stored.

.VARIABLE RESCOL
   RESCOL=R1          The  integer R1 specifies the  column which 
                      will  receive the residuals corresponding 
		      to the dependent variables for each data
		      point.  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.

.VARIABLE RESCOL2
   RESCOL2=R2         The integer R2 specifies the column which
                      will receive the residuals corresponding
                      to the dependent variables for each data
                      point.  It corresponds to COEFFCOL2 and
                      DEPCOL2.  If this parameter is omitted,
                      then no residuals for DEPCOL2 are stored.

.VARIABLE CONCOL
   CONCOL=C           The integer C specifies a control column 
                      which produces a separate fit for each 
                      group of identical numbers in the control 
                      column.  If this keyword is omitted, then 
                      the whole file is DGELGd in one least 
                      squares fit.

.VARIABLE NOPRINT
    'NOPRINT	      Keyword to suppress printout of solution.

.VARIABLE THRESH
    THRESH=T          The real value T specifies the threshold
                      value which specifies the maximum allowable
                      residual value.  If the THRESH value is
                      specified, the program continues to perform
                      least squares fitting until all the
                      residuals are below this value.
