VICAR/IBIS Program XYZPIC2

PURPOSE

    XYZPIC2 is a C version of XYZPIC Fortran program.

    XYZPIC2 takes an IBIS-2 file of (line, sample, DN value)
triplets and creates an image of all zero value 
pixels except for those pixels indicated in the graphics 
file.  Any coordinates off of the image are ignored.
The DN values are clipped to fit within the DN range of the format
of the output pixels.  The points in the graphics file may be
in any order (sorting is performed by the program).  The line, sample
position of the points is rounded to the nearest pixel, while
the DN value is truncated for integer output formats.


EXECUTION

XYZPIC2 INP=POINTS.GRA  OUT=FILE.IMG  NL=3000 NS=5000 FORMAT=HALF

RESTRICTIONS

Will not process IBIS Graphics-1 file.  Input file must be an
IBIS Graphics-2 file.

The maximum output line length is 64,000 samples *(no longer
applies after convertion to C).
