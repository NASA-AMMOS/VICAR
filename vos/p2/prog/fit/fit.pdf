PURPOSE:

FIT is a VICAR applications program which performs automatic linear
stretches on halfword pictures anywhere in the halfword range (-32768
to +32767).  The program is primarily used to compress the DN range of
an image so that it "fits" within a 0-511 DN range (a restriction of some
older programs) or a 0-255 DN range, the latter being output in byte
data format.  The program employs a histogram based automatic stretch 
algorithm similar to program STRETCH.  FIT may also be used to print the
histogram.

EXECUTION:

	FIT  INP=A  OUT=B  user-parameters...

where the input image A must be in halfword (16-bit integer) data format.
The output image B may be specified to be in byte or halfword data
format (see OFORM keyword).  The maximum sample length is 10,000.

.page
DESCRIPTION OF THE AUTO-STRETCH ALGORITHM:

FIT computes a grey level frequency table (histogram) of the input 
image.  The histogram has 65536 bins, hence spans the entire halfword
range from -32768 to +32767.

If EXCLUDE=(N1,N2) is specified, the histogram is modified by setting:

	H(I) = 0 for N1 <= I <= N2

In addition, the histogram is modified by setting the low-saturation DN
to zero.  If the input image contains negative DN values, the low-saturation
DN is assumed to be -32768.  If not, then the low-saturation DN is 0.  This
feature may be suppressed via the INCLUDE keyword.

.page
The program determines linear stretch constants IMIN and IMAX such that:

 a) IMIN is the largest I which satisfies the equation
       A(-32768,I) <= PL * A(-32768,32767)

 b) IMAX is the smallest I which satisfies the equation
       A(I,32767) <= PH * A(-32768,32767)

where PL and PH may be specified by the LPER and HPER keywords.  The values
A(-32768,IMIN) and A(IMAX,32767) represent the shaded areas under the curve in 
the above graph.  Note that A(-32768,32767) is the total histogram area, and 
represents the number of samples in the image which have not been excluded.
.page
The linear stretch which is applied to the image is defined as follows:
	
	   HVAL - LVAL
      Y =  -----------*(X - IMIN) + LVAL
	   IMAX - IMIN

where X and Y are the input and output DN values respectively for each
pixel.  If Y is less than LVAL, then Y is set equal to LVAL.  If Y is greater
than HVAL, then Y is set equal to HVAL (See LVAL and HVAL parameters).

.page
DESCRIPTION OF PRINTED HISTOGRAMS AND STATISTICS:

After computing the histogram, the mean and standard deviation of the 
input image are printed out.

If the keyword PHIST is specified, the histogram is printed out.  Since
it is normally undesirable to print all the grey levels, the histogram
is condensed so that a maximum of NLIN grey levels are printed. 
This is accomplished by determining a suitable increment M.  Alternatively, 
the increment M may be specified via the HINC parameter.  The condensed
histogram H' may be interpreted as follows:

   H'(I) = H(I) + H(I+1) + ... + H(I+M-1)   for I=1, M+1, 2*M+1, 3*M+1,...
   H'(I) = 0  for all other I.

After zeroing out the excluded elements from the histogram, the mean and
standard deviation computed from the excluded histogram are printed out.  
If EHIST is specified, the excluded histogram is printed out.  Same 
comments as above apply.

EXAMPLES:

	FIT  INP=A  OUT=B  'BYTE  PERC=1.  EXCL=(12001,32767)

The halfword image contained in data set A is scaled to 8 bits, saturating
0.5 percent of the data at both ends of the histogram.  All sample values
less than 1 or greater than 12000 are ignored in the auto-stretch computation.

	FIT  INP=A  'PHIST 

The halfword histogram is printed.  No output image is produced.

	FIT  INP=A  OUT=B  'BYTE  PERC=1.0
The image is converted to byte data.

input DN corresponding to the lower saturation point on the histogram
is to be mapped. 
Default is LVALUE = 0.
.VARIABLE AREA
AREA is composed of four integers which correspond to a size field within 
which the histogram is to be computed.  AREA refers to pixels and is 
relative to line = 1, sample = 1, not to the origin of the size field 
(the default being the entire picture).
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
EXCLUDE is composed of pairs of integers specifying the exclusion of the 
DN range between them from auto_stretch computation.  EXCLUDE may have up
to 100 pairs of values, to specify multiple DN ranges.

The default is to exclude only 0 DN.
.VARIABLE INCLUDE
Before scanning the histogram for the stretch limits, the histogram is normally
modified by setting the low-saturation DN to zero.  If the input image contains
negative DN values, the low-saturation DN is assumed to be -32768.  If not,
then the low-saturation DN is 0.  This feature may be suppressed via the
INCLUDE keyword.

Note that if the user specifies a range using EXCLUDE that excludes the low-
saturation DN, the INCLUDE parameter is ignored.

PHIST is a keyword specifying the histogram of the input image is to be 
printed. Default is no histogram will be printed.
.VARIABLE EHIST
EHIST is a keyword specifying the excluded histogram is to be printed out.
.VARIABLE SPIKE
SPIKE is an integer specifying the number of spikes in the histogram. 
This parameter is used to control the scale of the frequency axis of the
printed histogram by setting the SPIKE + 1st highest frequency to the 
maximum value (100), and normalizing all other frequencies to this scale.
Default is SPIKE = 1.
.VARIABLE LOG
If the keyword 'LOG is specified, the frequency axis of the histogram is
printed using a logrithmic scale.
.VARIABLE NLIN 
NLIN is an integer specifying the number of grey levels to display in the
printed histogram.  This controls the number of lines printed per histogram.
Default NLIN = 256.
.VARIABLE HINC
HINC is an integer specifying the grey level increment factor for the 
printed histogram.  Note that if the number of lines printed exceeds NLIN,
the printout will be terminated.
The default is to have the program automatically compute the histogram
increment based upon the value of NLIN.
