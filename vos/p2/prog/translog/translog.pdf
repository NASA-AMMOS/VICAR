Translates a logical name
.help
Program Description

This procedure returns the translation of an input logical name (VMS)
or environment variable (Unix).  (The example listed below will translate
the name R2LIB).  A null string is returned if no translation is possible.
The name is case-sensitive under Unix, since environment variables are
case-sensitive.  It is not case-sensitive under VMS.

Note:  This program must be used from TAE; it will not work with shell-VICAR
due to implementation details.  But since all scripting languages (except
PDFs!) have better facilities than this for accessing env vars/log names,
this program is not needed with shell-VICAR.

Calling Sequence:

           VICAR> local trans type=(string,128)

           VICAR> translog R2LIB trans
           VICAR> disp trans
