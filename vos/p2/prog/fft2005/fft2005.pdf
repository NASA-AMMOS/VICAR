fft2005 - fft for images utilizing fftw
.HELP
PURPOSE:
Works similar to fft22, except as noted below.

The fftw package updates the old rcsfft package, removing
restrictions on the numeric factors of nl and ns:

1.  There can be a prime factor greater than 23
2.  The product of square-free factors can be larger
    than 210.
3.  In other words, the image can be any size, including
    odd numbers.
    
The whole image is read into memory (which is virtual
memory for most machines).  This should handle just about
anything that one would normally want.

Also, the ordering of the terms in the Fourier domain is different
for the new package.  But the ordering is more logical and is
self-consistent (applying the forward and then the inverse gives
the same image back).

The keyword QUADSWAP has been added so the inverse
transform after application of WIENER can have the four quadrants
moved back to picture position (including odd nl and/or ns cases).

The keyword INSECT has been added to allow a small point
spread function to be added into the center of a larger
image.  The parameter gives the size of the larger image
which will be zero filled except for the point spread function.
The center of the point spread function is aligned with the center
of the generated image input.  The definition of "center" for an
even sized image or point spread image is the n/2+1 pixel (i.e. the
lower right of the center four pixels.

The Keyword PREQSWAP performs a quadrant swap After the INSECT 
step but Before the FFTW processing step.

The Keyword NORM normalizes the psf Before the INSECT step.
Each pixel is divided by the sum of all pixels.

EXECUTION:

Example

fft2005 a b
fft2005 a b size=(2,1,4,4)
fft2005 b c 'inverse

see tstfft2005.pdf for examples of wiener filtering applications

OPERATION:
fft2005 reads in the whole image and applies fftw.
TIMING: 

O(line*samp*log(line*samp))
