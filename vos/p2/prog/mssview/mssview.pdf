VICAR Program "mssview"
.HELP
PURPOSE:

"mssview" makes an image that contains a scatterplot graph of two or three
	bands in an MSS format dataset.  The graph contains the scatterplot
	in a box in the middle of the image.  Around the sides of the image
	are labels with the minimum and maximum values and user defined
	labels.  The scatterplot can plot three dimensions by varying the
	intensity of the point by the value of the third dimension.
	Each dimension plotted is automatically scaled to fit.

EXECUTION EXAMPLES:

mssview  INPUT.MSS  OUTPUT.IMG  MSS=6 BANDS=(3,4) NLOUT=300 NSOUT=400 +
				LABELS=("RED BAND","IR BAND")

    In this example the input MSS format data set is INPUT.MSS and it is made
up of 6 bands.  The bands that will be plotted are the third and the fourth
in the dataset.  The number of lines in the output image will be 300 and the
number of samples will be 400.
    The output image is in byte format and the box and the labels have DN
value 255.  The data points are read in and the minimum and maximum are 
determined for each band.  The plot is scaled so that all of the points will
just fit in.  The characters are generated with a 7 by 5 dot matrix.  Larger 
size images will have multiple height characters.

mssview  INPUT.MSS  OUTPUT.IMG  MSS=5 BANDS=(1,2,5) 

    In this example, bands 1, 2, and 5 in INPUT.MSS will be plotted with
band 1 in the x direction, band 2 in the y direction, and band 5 plotted
as the intensity of the points.  The default output image size of 256 by
256 will used.  The intensity of the plotted points will range from a DN
value of 50 to a value of 250.

RESTRICTIONS:

The minimum output image size is 150 by 150 , and the maximum is 1000 by 1000.
The maximum number of data points that can be plotted is 50,000.
The maximum label length is 32 characters.
The maximum line length on the MSS format input dataset is 60,000 samples.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Vicar image arranged in MSS format which consists of all of the 
image bands appended in the sample dimensional.  See program MSS.
.VARIABLE OUT
Output scattergram image
.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard VICAR size field, except that SS and NS refer to each band
separately, not to the entire MSS file.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample, in each band separately.
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines.
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples, in each band separately.
.VARIABLE MSS
Number of bands in MSS format input dataset. 
Used to calculate where each band is.
.VARIABLE BANDS
Which bands to use in scatter plot. 
Can plot either 2 or 3 bands.
.VARIABLE NLOUT
Number of lines in output scatterplot image
.VARIABLE NSOUT
Number of samples in output scatterplot image
.VARIABLE LABELS
The labels associated with each band.  Will be
plotted along each axis.
.VARIABLE INCR
This specifies both LINC and SINC, q.v.
.VARIABLE LINC
Line increment:  this specifies that every LINC lines will be skipped,
in order to reduce the number of data points.
.VARIABLE SINC
Sample increment:  this specifies that every SINC samples will be skipped,
in order to reduce the number of data points.
.VARIABLE THRESH
If THRESH is specified then all DN values below this value will be ignored.
