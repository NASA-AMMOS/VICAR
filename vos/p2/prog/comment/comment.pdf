Displays comments during execution of a procedure
.HELP
PURPOSE
The COMMENT program is used to have a PDF file display a comment as it
executes. For example, to record the actions of a test file, you might
execute the following commands:
    VICAR>enable-log
    VICAR>comment "Execution of COLOR test file before modification+
    VICAR>+to remove call to LABELC"
    VICAR>tstcolor
    VICAR>disable-log

These commands would produce the following session file:
    comment "Execution of COLOR test file before modification +
    to remove call to LABELC"
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:04:16
    Execution of COLOR test file before modification to remove call to LABELC
 
    --------------------
    tstcolor
    GEN COLORA NL=3 NS=10 IVAL=0 LINC=128 SINC=128
    Beginning VICAR task GEN                 
    GEN VERSION 5
    GEN TASK COMPLETED
    LIST COLORA
	:    :    :
    disable-log

COMMENT can also be used to simply date a session. If you enter
    VICAR>enable-log
    VICAR>comment ""
    VICAR>disable-log

the session file will contain
    comment ""
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:19:20
 
    --------------------
    disable-log


If no argument is supplied to COMMENT, you are interactively requested
for a comment. For example, if you place a call to COMMENT in a PDF file,
then every time the PDF file is executed, you are requested to enter a
comment; this comment can then be related to the particular session. For
example, the command sequence
    VICAR>enable-log
    VICAR>comment

will yield the following display and prompt:
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:19:45
    Comment:

If you answered by typing
    A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set

the display would show
    Comment: A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set
    A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set

    --------------------

The session file would contain:
    comment
    Beginning VICAR task COMMENT             
    --------------------
 
    Date: 29-JUN-87    Time: 16:19:45
    A test with the shorter version of the Oakland data set

    --------------------

If you answered by simply entering the RETURN key, then the session file
would appear the same as if you had specified the command
    comment ""
