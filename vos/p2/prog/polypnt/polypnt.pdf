PURPOSE

     POLYPNT is used to transform a standard polygon file into an 
     image  file of polygon borders with each border painted at a 
     unique DN level.   The input data in coordinate-point format 
     is used to form a raster image containing polygon  outlines.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
     POLYPNT INP=G OUT=PIC SIZE PARAMS
     where
     G                        is  the IBIS Graphics polygon data to 
                              be scribed,
     PIC                      is  the output raster dataset  onto 
                              which  the  scribed image  will  be 
                              written,
     SIZE                     is  the standard VICAR size  field.  
                              The  size  field provides a  window 
                              through which the lines are scribed 
                              and is required by the program, and
     PARAMS                   is   a  standard  VICAR   parameter 
                              field.

OPERATION
     POLYPNT  scribes lines in a holding array which is a  subset 
     of the window described in the SIZE parameter.  It processes 
     one  line at a time calculating slope,  beginning and ending 
     points  to determine which pixels will be filled to  connect 
     the  points.   It looks for intersections (previously  coded 
     pixels)  and  outputs notations to  the  optionally  tabular 
     file.   The completed strip is written to the output dataset 
     before a new strip is started.
EXAMPLE
        POLYPNT INP=G OUT=PIC SIZE=(1,1,512,512) +
                'PAINT 'INTE
     In this example, POLYPNT reads the dataset, IN and writes 
     the scribed image onto the datset PIC. The output image is 
     512 x 512  and contains lines and intersections with sequential 
     DN values starting with DN 1.  The background is DN 0.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
    INP=G                      is  the Graphics I or  II  polygon 
                               data to be scribed,
.VARIABLE OUT
    OUT=
     PIC                      is  the output raster dataset  onto 
                              which  the  scribed image  will  be 
                              written,
.VARIABLE DN
     DN,n                     the  integer  n  specifies  the  DN 
                              value  to  be  used  on  the  first 
                              scribed line.  The default is 1.
.VARIABLE BDN
     BDN,n                    the  interger  n specifies  the  DN 
                              value  of  the   background.    The 
                              default is zero.
.VARIABLE PDN
     PDN,n                    the  integer  n  specifies  the  DN 
                              value  to  be  used  on  the  first 
                              intersection.

.VARIABLE RANGE
     RANGE,l,h...             specifies Graphics user codes to 
                              paint.   Each  pair has a  low  and 
                              high integer.

.VARIABLE SELECT
     SELECT,n...              specifies Graphics user codes to 
                              paint.

.VARIABLE MODE
     HALF                     specifies halfword output.

     PAINT                    causes  each new line to be encoded 
                              with a unique DN.

     INTE                     cause  each new intersection to  be 
                              encoded with a unique DN.

     GR2                      specifies that the input and output 
                              datasets are in Graphics II format.  
                              This parameter is not necessary  if 
                              the  input  dataset is  labeled  as 
                              being Graphics II.
