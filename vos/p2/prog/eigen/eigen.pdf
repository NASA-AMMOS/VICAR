Procedure EIGEN -- Principal component analysis using eigenvectors.
.HELP
PURPOSE:
	EIGEN will compute the principal component (aka the eigenvector or
Karhunen-Loeve) transformation matrix of up to 32 input channels.  
The covariance (or, optionally, correlation) matrix, the transformation
matrix of eigen-vectors, and the eigen-values are printed.  If outputs are
provided, XFORM is executed to perform the transformation.  EIGEN can also
compute the eigen-vectors for non-image data input via the parameters NVAR
and DATA.

NOTE:
	The present version of EIGEN has been modified extensively from the
version used prior to September, 1985.  It has been changed from VICAR1 to
VICAR2, and converted into a procedure.  This procedure executes the program
EIGENVEC, which performs the function of the previous EIGEN program, then,
if output datasets are provided, it executes XFORM to perform the transforma-
tion.
	The meaning of parameters SAVE and TSAVE has been changed completely.
The eigenvector matrix and its transpose are now automatically saved as VICAR2
parameter datasets.  The names of these parameter datasets can be provided by
the user via the SAVE and TSAVE parameters, and by default they are temporary
datasets with the names EMATRIX and TMATRIX, respectively. Note that the
datasets no longer appear in the output dataset field.
	In addition, the color decorrelation stretch algorithm (formerly the
VICAR program DSTRETCH) has been implemented within EIGEN, via the parameter
DSTRETCH.

OPERATION:

	The measure of inter-dimensional correlation in the multi-variate
system is usually defined by the covariance matrix of the multi-variate
data.  The linear transformation that diagonalizes the covariance matrix 
can also be applied to the original data and produce a multi-variate 
system with an inter-dimensional correlation of zero, i.e.; completely
uncorrelated multi-variate data.  The linear transformation that
accomplishes this is the matrix of eigen-vectors or characteristic vectors.

	A common application of this transformation is to reduce the 
dimensionality of a multi-variate system.  The objective is to summarize
most of the variance, or information content, in a system with a 
lessor number of 'artificial' variates, i.e.; principal components. 
Effectively, by uncorrelating the system, we are compressing most of the
information into a system with lower dimensionality. 

	Assume an n-variate system ( n channels of data ).  Let K be the 
n x n covariance matrix of this data and A be the matrix of eigen-vectors
of K.  Associated with each eigen-vector A(j) there is an eigen-value or 
characteristic root, e(j).

	Let A(j) = (a(1j),a(2j),...,a(nj)) be the eigen-vector corresponding 
	to the jth largest eigen-value.

	Let X = (x(1),x(2),...,x(n)) be the n-variate observation 
	( n-dimensional pixel ).

	Then the jth principle component is: v(j) = A(j)  X = a(ij)x(i)

NOTE:  The jth eigen-value is actually the variance in the jth 
principle componemt dimension.  Therefore, the eigen-values are useful 
as a measure the information content that can be expected in the output 
pictures.


RESTRICTIONS:

EIGEN can handle up to 32 channels of data. However, the number of input and
output datasets is limited to 10 datasets. MSS format is needed for greater
than 10 input or output channels. The use of the array processor by
XFORM causes additional constraints in the combinations of inputs, outputs,
and number of samples. Consult the XFORM documentation for details.

The use of the LINC parameter will drastically reduce running time 
and, therefore, is recommended for large images.

The auto-scale mode of XFORM performs erratically if the number of inputs
and outputs is large and the eigen-value for the output being
auto-scaled is small.  There is no precise rule for this, but for byte 
data be skeptical of auto-scaling if:

			(# of outputs)SQRT(# of inputs)
	EIGEN-VALUE <  ---------------------------------
					3




EXAMPLES:

	EIGEN IN (V1,V2,V3,V4) (10,15,350,400) MSS=6 PERCENT=1.0 EXCLUDE=0

    The input dataset contains 6 channels in mss format.  Any pixels with 
    DN = 0 in all channels will be ignored.  XFORM will perform the 
    transformation and allow 1% saturation of the output pictures which 
    are the first 4 principle components.


	EIGEN (A,B,C,D,E) (V1,V2,V3) MSSO=(3,4,5) 'CORR AREA=(101,1,200,200)

    The input data is in separate datasets.  Principal components 3,4,
    and 5 only are to be output.  The correlation matrix is to be used 
    for computing the transformation and only the area specified is 
    used for computing the transformation and the auto-scaling. 

	EIGEN  NVAR=3  DATA=(1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.,7.,8.,9.)

    The multi-variate data is input through the parameter field.
    EIGEN will print the covariance matrix and the eigen-vectors for this data.

Input datasets containing registered images, or a single input dataset 
in MSS format.
.VARIABLE OUT
Output datasets containing transformed images, or a single output
dataset in MSS format.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size field ( starting_line, starting_sample, 
number_of_lines, number_of_samples).
.VARIABLE LINC
Statistics are gathered using only every n'th line of the image. If
the auto-scaling option of XFORM is invoked, every n'th line is used to
determine the scaling parameters.
.VARIABLE INC
Statistics are gathered using only every n'th line and n'th sample of the
image. If different line and sample increments are desired, use INC to
specify the sample increment and use LINC to override the INC line increment
value.
.VARIABLE CORR
The correlation matrix is used for computing eigenvectors instead of the
covariance matrix.
.VARIABLE DSTRETCH
When the DSTRETCH keyword is used, the output will be a set of images that
have been modified by a color decorrelation stretch transformation, rather
than the eigenvector transformation.
.VARIABLE DSCALE
This parameter has effect only when used with the DSTRETCH parameter. The
DSTRETCH operation consists of a rotation into principal component space,
rescaling to cause variance equalization among components, and the reverse
rotation out of principal component space. DSCALE applies an additional
scaling at the variance equalization stage. This can be used to suppress
components known to be noisy, at the expense of re-introducing some 
correlation among bands.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
A pixel is excluded from use in determining the transformation if the 
DN is equal to 'EXCLUDE' in each channel. If the auto-scaling option of 
XFORM is used, these pixels will also be excluded from the computation of
scaling parameters.
.VARIABLE MSS
Denotes the input data is in MSS format and contains 'MSS' number of 
channels of data.
.VARIABLE USE
If the input is in MSS format, use only the listed channels. The default
is that all channels are used.
.VARIABLE MSSO
Denotes that that output is to be in MSS format, and will contain 'MSSO'
components (bands) of data.
.VARIABLE OUTPUT
The output will consist of the specified components. The default is to
output the first n components, where n is the number of output datasets,
or for MSS format output, the value of MSSO.
.VARIABLE SAVE
The eigenvector transformation matrix will be saved as a VICAR2 parameter
dataset with the name denoted by the SAVE parameter.
.VARIABLE TSAVE
The transpose of the eigenvector transformation matrix will be saved as a
VICAR2 parameter dataset with the name denoted by the TSAVE parameter. This
matrix produces the rotation necessary to return to the original coordinate
system.
.VARIABLE AREA
Sets of (Starting_line, Starting_sample, Number_of_lines, Number_of_samples)
are given to define subareas used to generate the image statistics. If
auto-scaling is used in XFORM, only the first subarea listed will be used
to gather the auto-scaling statistics. The default is that the entire image 
is sampled.
.VARIABLE NVAR
Integer specifying the dimensionality of the data.  This parameter is 
only used when multi-variate data is input through the parameter field
(DATA).
.VARIABLE DATA
1 to 500 data values may be input through the parameter field. That is, the
number of case times NVAR must be no greater than 500. No input data sets 
are used in this mode.  The covariance matrix and the eigenvectors for this 
set of data are computed and printed.
.VARIABLE SCALE
SCALE=(I1,P1,Q1,I2,P2,Q2,...)   The output image specified by band number I 
is scaled by offset P and gain Q. The outputs not specified by I will be 
defaulted to the preset value.
.VARIABLE PRESET
An offset of P = 0.5 (integer data) or 0 (real data) and gain Q = 1 is
applied to all output bands.
.VARIABLE GAIN
    GAIN=Q                   For all no output bands
 or GAIN=(I1,Q1,I2,Q2,...)   Each output band specified by I is scaled 
			     by  gain Q. The output bands not specified by 
			     I will be defaulted to the PRESET value.
.VARIABLE OFFSET
    OFFSET=P                 For all no output bands
 or OFFSET=(I1,P1,I2,P2,...) Each output band specified  by I is scaled by
			     offset P. The output bands not specified by I 
			     will be defaulted to the PRESET value.
.VARIABLE SAMPLE
In the auto-scale phase of XFORM, SAMP percent of the picture is to be
sampled in the line direction only; i.e., LINC=100/sample. (default is 10%,
if AREA and LINC are not specified.)
.VARIABLE PERCENT
This denotes the desired percent saturation in the output images,
 one-half at each end. (default=1.0)
.VARIABLE LPERCENT
This denotes the desired percent saturation in the output images at the
dark end. (default=0.5)
.VARIABLE HPERCENT
This denotes the desired percent saturation in the output images at the
bright end. (default=0.5)
.VARIABLE SPREAD
The desired range of the output histograms. (default=full range of the 
data type)
.VARIABLE CENTER
The desired center of the output histograms. (default=spread/2 for byte data, 
=0.0 otherwise.)
.VARIABLE FORMAT
 Valid keyword values: BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL.
 This specifies the output data format. 
.vari NOAP
This keyword is only meaningful if the proc invokes XFORM, i.e., if an
output file has been specified.

Specifying NOAP indicates that the Array Processor program XFORMAP should
not be used by the XFORM proc.  Instead, program XFORMEM will be invoked.

Default is to invoke XFORMAP if the AP is available and if NS is a power
of 2 between 2 and 16384; otherwise to use XFORMEM.
