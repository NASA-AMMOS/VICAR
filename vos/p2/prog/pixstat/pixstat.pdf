VICAR Program PIXSTAT
.HELP

PURPOSE:

PIXSTAT is a VICAR applications program for computing the mean, second
moment, variance, or standard deviation of the local area surrounding each
pixstatel in an image.

EXECUTION:

  PIXSTAT IN OUT NLW=m NSW=n 'CALC
where
  IN is the input image (byte or halfword),
  OUT is the output image (byte, halfword, fullword, or real),
  NLW and NSW specify the height and width of the local area,
  CALC is a keyword selecting the statistic to be computed.

CALC has the following valid values: MEAN, MOMENT, VARIANCE, SDEV.

OPERATION:

PIXSTAT is a filtering operation.  For example, the following two executions
will result in the same output:

	PIXSTAT  A  B  NLW=3 NSW=3  'MEAN
        FILTER   A  B  NLW=3 NSW=3  WEIGHTS=(1,1,1,1)

However, unlike the general purpose FILTER program, the output of PIXSTAT 
is limited to one of the following statistical quantities:  mean, second
moment, variance, and standard deviation.  The CALC keyword is used to select
the statistic to be computed.  The valid values for CALC are MEAN, MOMENT,
VARIANCE, SDEV.

The pixstatel height and width of the filter window is specified by the NLW and
NSW parameters.  For example,

	PIXSTAT  A  B  NLW=9 NSW=11  'SDEV

will cause each pixstatel to be replaced by the standard deviation of the 9 x 11
pixstatel area centered on that pixstatel.

The input image may be in BYTE or HALFWORD data format.

The FORMAT keyword may be used to specify the output data format.  The valid
output formats are BYTE, HALF, FULL, and REAL.  If the output is in integer
format (BYTE, HALF, or FULL), the values are rounded to the nearest integer
and values outside the output DN range are truncated.

If the output format is not specified, the output will have the same format as
the input image.

If MOMENT or VARIANCE are specified, the output DN range may be larger than the
input DN range.  One or more of the following options can be used to avoid data
truncation:

  1) Increase the number of bits in the output via the FORMAT keyword
  2) Specify a floating point output (FORMAT=REAL)
  3) Scale the output using the SCALE parameter

.page
STATISTICAL EQUATIONS:

Let N be the number of pixstatels in the filter window, i.e. N=NLW*NSW.  The MEAN
is the sum of all DN values in the window divided by N:

		       SUM of DN
		MEAN = ---------
			   N

The SECOND MOMENT is the sum of the squares of all DN values in the window
divided by N:
			 SUM of DN**2
		MOMENT = ------------
			     N

The VARIANCE is the sum of squared differences from the mean divided by N:

		    SUM of (DN - MEAN)**2
	VARIANCE = ----------------------- = MOMENT - MEAN**2
			     N

The STANDARD DEVIATION is the square root of the variance.

		SDEV = VARIANCE**0.5

For pixstatels along the margins of the image, the surrounding area is completed
by reflecting the image at its boundaries.  E.g. if the upper-left pixstatel
is assigned coordinates (0,0), then the surrounding area for this pixstatel is
filled in via the following steps:

	1) DN(-i,j) = DN(i,j)	i=-1,-2,-3,...,-NLW/2, j=0,1,2,...,NSW/2
	2) DN(i,-j) = DN(i,j)   j=-1,-2,-3,...,-NSW/2, i=-NLW/2 to +NLW/2

MEMORY REQUIREMENTS:

Since memory is dynamically allocated by the program, there are no restrictions
on the size of the input image or the size of the filter window.  However, if
either of these is larger than the available physical memory, an excessive
number of page faults will occur, and images which normally take seconds
to process may instead require hours.  The relevant variables are the width of
the image (NS) and the height of the filter (NLW).  Total memory requirements
depend also on which variable is being calculated:

       'MEAN:  number of bytes = 2*(NLW+5)*NS
       OTHER:  number of bytes = 2*(NLW+13)*NS

Note that no extra memory is required to reflect the image at the margins since
this operation is conceptually rather than physically performed.

Under normal operation, it should take no more than 6 seconds to compute the
standard deviation for a 1000 x 1000 image.
