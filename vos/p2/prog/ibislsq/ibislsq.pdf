PURPOSE

   "ibislsq" performs least squares fits on data in an IBIS interface
(tabular) file.  The solutions and/or residuals can be placed in 
specified columns of the file.  The solutions can also be output
to the terminal.  Multiple fits can be done on different parts of
one file.


EXECUTION

     ibislsq INP=DATA.INT  INDCOL=(1,2,3) DEPCOL=(4,5) CONCOL=7 +
	     SOLCOL=(10,11) RESCOL=(8,9)  'NOPRINT

    This example shows the use of all of the parameters.  The input
file, DATA.INT, is an IBIS interface file.  The data for the independent
variables are in columns (1,2,3), and the data for the dependent 
variables are in columns (4,5).  The control column is used for
multiple fits to be done in one run.  The least square fits are done 
on sets of rows; a new set is started whenever the value in the control 
column changes.  If no control column is specified then one fit
is done on the whole file.  The SOLCOL and RESCOL parameters specify
in which columns, of the input file, the results will be put.  If either
or both are not specified then they will not be output.  There must be
as many solution columns and residual columns as there are dependent 
columns.  The data in the residual columns correspond one-to-one with
the data in the dependent columns.  The solution is put out in the
first N rows of the SOLCOL columns, where N is the number of independent
columns; the rest of the rows in the set are filled with zeros.   Normally
the solution for each set is printed to the terminal, but this can 
be turned off with the 'NOPRINT keyword.

    The length of each set should, of course, be longer than the
number of independent variables (columns).  If it is not then the
least squares fit will not be called and values of -999.0 will be
put out for the solution.  If some columns of the independent data
are dependent then the error MATRIX RANK TOO SMALL be be printed,
and -999.0's will be put out for the solution.  If there is no
solution then zeros will be put out for the residuals.



EXAMPLES

   Suppose that columns 1 and 2 contain points (x,y) in a plane 
   and  column  7 contains a function  f(x,y).   The  following 
   sequence  will perform a quadratic least squares fit  h(x,y) 
   and place the residuals in column 8.

   mf INP=A FUNCTION=("C3=C1*C1","C4=C2*C2","C5=C1*C2","C6=1")
   ibislsq INP=A INDCOL=(1,2,3,4,5,6) DEPCOL=7 RESCOL=8


RESTRICTIONS

The maximum number of independent columns (variables) is 20.
The maximum number of dependent columns (variables) is 5.
The maximum length of any set is 5000.
The maximum column length of the file is 10000.
Interface files are assumed to have 40 or less columns.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
   INP=file           Input IBIS interface file
.VARIABLE INDCOL
   INDCOL=(N1,...,Nk) The   integers   N1,...,Nk  specify   the 
                      columns  which contain the data  for  the 
                      independent variables.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE DEPCOL
   DEPCOL=(M1,...,Ml) The   integers   M1,...,Ml  specify   the 
                      columns  which contain the data  for  the 
                      dependent variables.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE SOLCOL
   SOLCOL=(S1,...,Sl) The integers  S1,...,Sl specify columns 
                      which receive the solution coefficients 
                      corresponding to the dependent variables.
		      The first k rows contain the solutions for
		      the corresponding k independent columns.
		      If this parameter is omitted, then the  
		      solution is not stored.
.VARIABLE RESCOL
   RESCOL=(R1,...,Rl) The  integers  R1,...,Rl specify columns 
                      which  receive the residuals corresponding 
		      to the dependent variables for each data
		      point.  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.
.VARIABLE CONCOL
   CONCOL=C           The integer C specifies a control column 
                      which produces a separate fit for each 
                      group of identical numbers in the control 
                      column.  If this keyword is omitted, then 
                      the whole file is DGELGd in one least 
                      squares fit.
.VARIABLE NOPRINT
