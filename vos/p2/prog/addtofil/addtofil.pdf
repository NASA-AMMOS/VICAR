REVISION HISTORY:
   06-1-89  HBM   Initial release.
   11-5-96  SP    Converted from DCL to C for portability.
   01-3-97  SP    Since the C version crashed on VMS, renamed the C version
                  addtofil, and wrote a procedure to call DCL on VMS and to
                  call addtofil on UNIX.
