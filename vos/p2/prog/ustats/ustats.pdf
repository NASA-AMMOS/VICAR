	Program USTATS
.HELP
 Purpose:  USTATS is a VICAR applications program that performs an
unsupervised clustering algorithm upon multispectral data.  The output
is a statistics data set compatible with the program FASTCLAS.
 Operation:  A sampling of pixels is chosen, determined by the INC, LINC
or SINC keyword parameters.  The first sampled pixel is set as the first
cluster.  For each of the remaining pixels to be sampled, the following
operations are performed:

      1) The Euclidean distance from the mean of each cluster is
         computed.  The Euclidean distance is defined as:
           (E.D.)**2 = SUM OVER ALL BANDS of [DN{mean} - DN{pixel}]**2

      2) If the Euclidean distance to each of the existing clusters
         is greater than the value specified by the INITIAL parameter,
         a new cluster if formed by this pixel.  Otherwise, the pixel
         is added to the nearest cluster, and that cluster's mean for
         each band is recomputed.

      3) The neighboring pixel to the left is then checked to see
         whether it can be grouped into the same cluster.  If its
         Euclidean distance is not greater than the INITIAL parameter,
         it too is added to the cluster, and the means recomputed.
         This process is repeated until a pixel is found that cannot
         Be added to the cluster.

      4) The pixel(s) to the right is (are) checked in the same manner
         as in Step 3.

If the NONN parameter has been specified, Steps 3 & 4 are omitted.  If,
at some point, this process generates more clusters than have been
specified in the CLUSTER parameter, the message, 'SAMPLING INCOMPLETE AT
LINE n' will be printed.  No more pixels will be sampled, but processing
will continue.

When the sampling process is complete, the clusters that have been
formed are examined.  Clusters containing only one pixel are removed.
Standard deviations for each band in each cluster are calculated and,
if the one-standard-deviation regions of two clusters overlap, they
are merged into one cluster.  The remaining clusters are sorted by
population.

The number of clusters to be retained as classes for output is determined
by the CLASSES and PERCENT parameters.  If either of these parameters
is specified, the default of 10 clases is overridden.  If both parameters
are specified, both conditions must be met to be included as an output
class.

The output statistics data set is of the same format as the output data
set from STATS, and is suitable for input into FASTCLAS.  The 
only difference is that USTATS does not compute the off-diagonal
elements of the correlation matrix, but sets them to zero.

 Restrictions: 
1)    Image size is internally restricted to 32000 samples.
2)    12 input data sets

 Examples:

  1) USTATS (A,B,C,D) ST INC=10 INITIAL=8.0 CLUSTERS=300 +
            EXCLUDE=0  CLASSES=15
     In this example every tenth sample of every tenth line is sampled.
     The initial clusters have an 8.0 DN radius and up to 300 clusters
     may be formed.  Pixels of 0 DN are ignored.  The 15 most populous
     clusters are output.

  2) USTATS MS ST (1,1,500,1000) MSS=6 USE=(1,2,4,5,6) SINC=5 +
            PERCENT=1.0
     In this example the input is in MSS format and contains 6 bands,
     but the third band is not to be used.  Every fifth sample of every
     twentieth line (default) is sampled.  Those clusters that are at
     least 1% of all pixels sampled are retained for output.

  3) USTATS MS ST MSS=4 'NONN
     In this example, there are 4 MSS bands, all are to be used, and
     nearest neighbors are not to be sampled.

      5 SEP 94   ...CRS (CRI) REVISE FOR PORTING
     10 JUL 95   ...VRU (CRI) CHANGED FIRST OUTPUT FILE FORMAT TO ISTATFILE
     15 APR 98   ...RRP (AR-9900) UPDATED USTATS.PDF TO RESTRICT CERTAIN
                        PARAMETERS TO BE LESS THEN OR EQUAL TO ZERO.
     16 JUL 2011 ...RJB...  Clean up code to prevent warning messages
                            with gfortran 4.4.4 compiler under Linux
                            Remove MSS actions, MSS and USE parms.
                            Convert to HALF and BYTE data set operations
                            Fix a wide range of logic and coding errors.
                            The biggest problem was incorrect variance
                            computation which was not dividing by number of pts.

    21 Jul 2011 ...RJB...  Add complete covariance matrix, not just diagonal.
                            Debugging code and comments need to be removed.
                            This version needed in quick turn around.
