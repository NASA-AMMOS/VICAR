VICAR Program GETPC
.HELP
PURPOSE

GETPC is a VICAR application program which computes the line-sample
coordinates of the target-center from SPICE kernels and outputs it as a TAE
variable.  In addition, it will return SCLAT, SCLON and SCALE as TAE variables
when processing Galileo or Cassini images.

For Cassini and Galileo, the image-space planet center is returned.  For
Voyager, the object-space planet center is returned.

EXECUTION

     GETPC INP=InpFile PCL=PCL PCS=PCS SCLAT=SCLAT SCLON=SCLON SCALE=SCALE

where InpFile is a Cassini, Galileo, or Voyager image.

HISTORY:
 WHEN       WHO WHAT
 ---------- --- ---------------------------------------------------------------
 01/30/2003 GMY Upgraded to support Cassini.  Ported to Linux.
 12/17/1996 SMC Modified to report the correct SCLAT and SCLON.       (FR89983)
 10/08/1996 SMC Modified to adapt CONVEV and CONVISOS calling sequence so that
                 Summation Mode images are supported.                 (FR89818)
 07/23/1996 SMC Initial release (Combined unported GLLPC and unported VGRPC)

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The input file of interest.  This should be a geometrically corrected image (in
Galileo's case it can be just a raw image).
.VARI PCL
Planet Center Line pixel
.VARI PCS
Planet Center Sample pixel
.VARI SCLAT
SpaceCraft LATtitude
.VARI SCLON
SpaceCraft LONtitude
.VARI SCALE
The scale of the size of the given image pixel as compared to the actual size
of the object.  In an other word, this shows how big of a ground coverage the
pixel represents.
.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  If defaulted, the target
name is extracted from the VICAR label or determined by other TBD means.

A complete list of valid target names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.  Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode,
the other mode is attempted.

.VARI CKNAME
CKNAME is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used:

  CKNAME        C KERNEL
  --------      -------------
  DAVI          MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV           MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE          MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2          MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR          MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS          MIPS_AMOS.CK
  NAIF          the best NAIF kernel is used

If defaulted, the kernels are searched in the above order.

.VARI CKID
CKID is an alternative way to specify the prefered C-kernel (see CKNAME
parameter):

  CKID    CKNAME        C KERNEL
  ----    --------      -------------
  M906    DAVI          MIPS_DAVI.CK
  M905    NAV           MIPS_NAV.CK
  M904    FARE          MIPS_FARENC.CK
  M903    NAV2          MIPS_NAV2.CK
  M902    NEAR          MIPS_NEAR.CK
  M901    AMOS          MIPS_AMOS.CK
  varies  NAIF          there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, CKID overrides the CKNAME parameter.

.VARI USERID
USERID is a three character string which identifies the user who created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  USERID=HBM identifies Helen Mortensen as the creator of the camera
     pointing.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group which created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which created
the camera pointing.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=MIPS specifies that MIPS created the camera pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI PROGRAM
PROGRAM is the first six characters of the program creating the camera pointing.

Ex:  PROGRAM=FARENC specifies that FARENC created the camera pointing.

.VARI SPKID
SPKID specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
SP kernel used to create the camera pointing.  The SP-kernel IDs are located
in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable)
KERNELDB.

Ex:  SPKID=N015 specifies the SP kernel GLL_LONG_2.BSP

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.

Ex:  REQNUM=3456 identifies (somewhat) request number R123456

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.
