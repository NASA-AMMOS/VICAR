.title
Returns number of files in a list created by SRCH
.HELP
CNT returns the total number of files in a list created by the proc
SRCH, and also the number of the next file in that list.  It does
not modify the file in any way.

CNT is intended to be used in a proc to provide the calling proc with
information about the file.  For interactive use, use the TCL procedure
COUNT.
.level1
.vari input
Input -- File name
.vari total
Output -- total number of
names in list.
.vari nxtfil
Output -- Number of next
file in list.
.level2
.vari input
The input to CNT is a file which consists of a list of file names
(or perhaps other strings) created by the proc SRCH.  It is an ASCII
file which may be edited using a text editor if desired.
.vari total
Upon completion of CNT, TOTAL contains the total number of members 
contained in the INPUT list.
.vari nxtfil
Upon completion of CNT, the parameter given for NXTFIL contains the
number of the next file to be referenced in the INPUT list, but
does not modify the input in any way (see program NXT).
