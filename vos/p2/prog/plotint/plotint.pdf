VICAR/IBIS Program PLOTINT
.HELP
PURPOSE

     PLOTINT plots data contained in columns of an IBIS interface file
    using the gnuplot plotting package.

.PAGE
OPERATION
    
    PLOTINT allows columns of an IBIS interface to be plotted. Either lines
or symbols may be plotted, along with annotations using the gnuplot plotting
package. Plots may be displayed on the desktop or as an encapsulated
postscript file.


PARAMETERS

    INPUT is the name of the ibis interface (tabular) File containing the
    columns to be plotted.

    PLOTOUT is the name of the output plot 

    The column number of independent data is XCOL and the column(s) of dependent
    data are in YCOL. Up to 20 dependent columns are allowed.    

    YCOLSTR are the names of the dependent columns. Up to 20.

    The parameter CONTROL points to a column used to identify a specific line in the
    IBIS file. If the number in the column is only 1 then all columns are the same
    line. 1's, 2's, 3's etc. refer to different lines.  Must have the
    same entry for all of the rows that are to be on one plot.

    XLEN and YLEN are the axes lengths in inches.

    XLABEL and YLABEL are the labels for their respective axes.

    TITLE is the Title to be placed on the graph.

    LABELSIZ is the font size for the text on the plot in points. Default=10
  
    FREQ specifies the frequency of the points to be plotted. If 2 then
    every other point is plotted. You do not have to enter a freq value
    for each line. If you have 3 lines and enter freq=2, then it is understood
    that the other two lines will have a freq of 1. 
    Default is to plot each point (1). 

    The SYMTYPE parameter specifies what type of plotting is done for 
    each dependent variable:  
    1 for symbols only, 
    2 for both symbols and points,
    3 for lines only.  

    XRANGE and YRANGE are the max and min values to plot on their respective
    axes.
    
    Up to 3 comments (COMMENT1,COMMENT2,COMMENT3) can be placed on graph. They
    will be on right side of graph.
.PAGE
PLOT OUTPUTS

    The other type of output come from the PLOTOUT and PLOTFMT parameters.
PLOTOUT allows the user to display data from 5 areas on the CCD on an x,y
plot using the gnuplot package after exiting the program. PLOT produces
a file of gnuplot commands contained in a file having a .gpi file extension.
Another file with an .asc extension is create containing columns of data
that are displayed by the gpi file.

   The PLOTFMT parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing PLOTFMT=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.

.PAGE

  PLOT NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the PLOTOUT parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  PLOTOUT=outplot
  then for the interactive plot the following files are produced:

     outplot.gpi
     outplot.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot. 

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with PLOTFMT=eps
  then the following files are produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     outplot.asc

  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps

  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the plot command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  plot  'outplot.asc' u  1: 9 t .......

USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which are written out as a separate file. The plot is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the plot by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the plot by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the plot. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the plot to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the plot is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains columns of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions are discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the plot alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.

  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi

  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the plot).

  Note: This program creates 5 output plots per run. You bring up each plot
  panel sequentially. You close each plot by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the plot.


  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  plot suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy plot via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps

.PAGE
    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT plot library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages are used.

.PAGE
EXAMPLES 


     PLOTINT INP=TRANS.INT XCOL=1 YCOL=(3,4) CONTROL=6  +
	YCOLSTR = ("AVERAGE POPULATION X1000","AIRLINE FLIGHTS") +
	XLABEL = "DISTANCE BETWEEN CITIES"  YLABEL = "THOUSANDS"  +
	TITLE = "GRAVITY TRANSPORTATION MODELS"   +
        XLEN=9.0 YLEN=7.5  SYMTYP=(1,1) 

     PLOTINT INP=FUNCTION.INT XCOL=2 YCOL=3 CONTROL=1 +
	XLABEL = "X-AXIS"  YLABEL = "Y-AXIS"  TITLE = "HYPERBOLA" +
	XLEN=6.0 YLEN=3.0 FREQ=4 SYMTYPE=2  +
	XRANGE=(-7.5,7.5) YRANGE=(0,100)  

    INP specifies the input interface file that contains the data to be 
plotted.  The column number of independent data is XCOL and the column(s)
of dependent data are in YCOL.  The control column (CONTROL) must have the
same entry for all of the rows that are to be on one plot.  The axis lengths
XLEN and YLEN are in inches.  


.PAGE
RESTRICTIONS

     The  control column must not specify more than 400 sets 
     (each set plotted on a different page).  Maximum number 
     of columns is 20.  All plotted texts must be shorter
     than 60 characters.

  2006-08    LWK fixed bug (Linux only) when YCOLSTR defaulted;
                 added NODISP and PLOTOUT parameters to support
                 output to file instead of display (no code needed
                 for NODISP as it is parsed by xrtps routines)
  2011-06-20 R. Bambery - Modified to use freeware gnuplot plotting package
  2011-09-20 R. Bambery - Fixed buf that overwrote clen in subroutine FINDCO
  2011-09-21 R. Bambery - Set yrange up to f9.2 from f7.2 and xrange from f9.2 from f7.2
  2012-07-03 R. Bambery - renamed to plotint2 for delivery to MIPL
                which still uses XRT/Graph package, removed debug
                statements, Removed <tab> in front of continuation
                lines to make backward compatible with
                32-bit Linux gfortran 4.2.1, otherwise
                compatible 64-bit Linux gfortran 4.6.3
  2012-10-21 R. Bambery - renamed back to plotint. in agreement
                with Lucas Kamp of mipl. The XRT graph package
                is to be removed from mipl. XRT was never used by
                cartlab.
  2012-12-09 R. Bambery - removed bad statement, and properly
                initialized some variables

                Remove vestiges of debug statements
  2013-09-05 R. Bambery - Fixed code that did not set xrange properly
                when writing out eps gpi files. Fixed freq array so
                values will never be 0. Fixed logic for plot ranges
                that are defaulted vs. inputs
  2013-09-06 R. Bambery - Added COMMENT1, COMMENT2, COMMENT3 parameters
  2015-08-19 W. Bunch - Fixed end of line encoding so linux and sun
                will yield same output.
