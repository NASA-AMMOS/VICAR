VICAR/IBIS Program "ibisregr"
.HELP
PURPOSE

 "ibisregr" performs a series of multiple linear regression analyses on IBIS
 tabular files, searching for a best fit.  This can be used, for example, 
 to find the best combination of spectral channels for determination of a
 physical parameter.


METHOD

 The program loops through all possible combinations of independent variables
 (columns) that are allowed by the user parameters, performing a linear
 least-squares fit ("regression analysis") of the dependent variable for
 each case.  The NBEST best solutions are retained and are printed to the
 terminal and optionally written to the output file.

 The criterion for the best fit is that the R-squared statistic be maximized,
 or the standard error be minimized, or both. The R-squared statistic is the
 fraction of the total variance in the dependent data that is explained by
 the regression.  The standard error of the estimate is the RMS average of
 the residuals (the misfit between the predicted and actual dependent data).  

 The optional output file contains three columns for each of the NBEST best
 fits:  the first shows the M input columns used for this solution (the
 first entry in this column is in row 2, and row 1 always contains a zero,
 denoting the constant term), the second column contains the M+1 regression
 coefficients (the first being the constant), and the third contains the
 residuals.

 NOTE: The multiple regression technique assumes that the residuals are
 uncorrelated and come from a normal distribution.

EXAMPLE

   ibisregr DATA.TAB REGR.TAB COLS=(1,2,5,7,8) COLRANGE=(3,4) DEPCOL=10 +
     NBEST=4 'STDERR 'PRINT 

 This case will search through all possible combinations of three and four of
 the five specified columns (columns 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8) in the input file
 DATA.TAB.  The dependent variable is in column 10.  The best four solutions
 will be retained and written to the file REGR.TAB, using the standard error
 as the criterion.  The solution for each combination will be printed to the
 terminal.

 The maximum number of input columns is 40.
 The maximum column length is 500.
 The maximum amount of data (number of columns times column length) is 10000.
 The maximum number of solutions that can be retained is 20.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input IBIS tabular file
.VARIABLE OUT      
An output IBIS tabular file
.VARIABLE DEPCOL
Dependent variable column
.VARI COLS
Columns to search through
.VARIABLE COLRANGE
(Minimum,maximum) number of
combinations of columns 
.VARIABLE NBEST
Number of solutions to retain
.VARIABLE DEPNAME
Heading for the dependent
variable.
.VARIABLE COLNAMES
Headings for the columns
.VARI CRITERIA
Criteria for best solution
.VARIABLE PRINT
Print output for each 
iteration?
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 Input IBIS tabular file containing the data to be fit.
.VARIABLE OUT      
 An output IBIS tabular file containing the NBEST best solutions.
.VARIABLE DEPCOL
 The column in the input file containing the dependent variable.

 The default is the last column.
.VARI COLS
 The columns in the input file through which to search (i.e., those
 containing all possible combinations of independent variables).

 The default is all columns except the last.
.VARIABLE COLRANGE
 The minimum and maximum number of combinations of columns to try.
 The program will start by examining all solutions using COLRANGE(1)
 columns (selected from those specified by the COLS parameter), then
 all solutions using [COLRANGE(1)+1] columns, up through COLRANGE(2)
 columns.

 The default is (2,NCOLS), where NCOLS is the number of columns
 specified in COLS.
.VARIABLE NBEST
 The number of highest-ranked solutions to retain, in order of the
 criteria specified by the CRITERIA parameter.
.VARIABLE DEPNAME
 An optional eight character heading for the dependent variable.
.VARIABLE COLNAMES
 Optional eight character headings for the columns containing the
 independent variables.
.VARI CRITERIA
 Criteria for the best solution(s).  Valid values are:

 RSQUARE:  only the R-squared value will be used as criterion (a higher 
  value is better).

 STDERR:  only the standard error will be used as criterion (a lower value
  is better).

 BOTH (default):  both the R-squared value and the standard error will be
  used as criteria, i.e., a solution is only accepted as better than a
  previous one if both criteria are satisfied.  

 EITHER:  a solution is accepted as better if either the R-squared or the
  standard error criterion is satisfied.

 Note that for BOTH and EITHER, the order in which the solutions are
 encountered will influence the final result if the two do not agree: if
 one solution is best by one of the criteria and a different one by the
 other, then in the case of BOTH the first solution encountered will be
 chosen and in the case of EITHER the second one.

 In general, the R-squared criterion will favor solutions using more
 dependent variables, whereas using more variables will be somewhat
 penalized by the standard deviation.
