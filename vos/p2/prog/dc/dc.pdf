VICAR1 program "dc"
     "dc" will fit a straight line to DN versus exposure at each pixel of
     several input frames and output a zero exposure or "dark current"
     picture. It will also optionally output a slope picture.
.HELP

PURPOSE:

	"dc" is a VICAR applications program which will fit a straight line
to DN versus exposure at each pixel of several input frames and output a zero
exposure or "dark current" picture. DC will also optionally output a slope
picture, a predicted Y value picture and/or a file of deviated points from
the fitted line. This allows the spatial responsivity of linear detectors to
be evaluated with two or more output pictures.

EXECUTION:

"dc" can be executed by the following statement:

	dc INP=(IN1,IN2,...) OUT=(DC,SLOPE,YPOINT,DELTA) SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS) PARMS

where INP, OUT, SIZE, and PARMS are required or optional parameters for DC
and are explained in TUTOR mode under TAE.

PARMS consist of the following parameters:

	EXPO	'NEGATIVE    MAXDN     SCALE 
	X       CONS

The input images may either be (all) byte or (all) halfword data.  The data 
format is taken from the VICAR label of the first input file.  The output image
has the same data format (byte or halfword) as the input image. 
.PAGE
OPERATION:

     "dc" fits a straight line on a pixel by pixel basis on two to ten input
pictures in a light transfer sequence. DC extrapolates to zero exposure. If the
analyst suspects for some reason that the zero exposure picture would be
negative, has the option of outputting the negative of the zero exposure
picture. Figure 1 graphically shows the concept involved.

Explanation of FIGURE 1:
		^ - is used to represent a delta
  		* - is used to represent a straight solid line
		. - are points of exposure


  EXAMPLES:

	dc INP=(A,B,C,D,E) OUT=(DC,SLOPE) EXPO=(3.0,4.0,1.0,2.5,2.2)+
	SCALE=2.0

     DC will fit a line to these points in a light transfer sequence and
     output a zero exposure level picture and a slope picture which is
     multiplied by 2.

     RESTRICTIONS:

	1. All the input frames must have as many or more lines and samples
	   as the first input.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
 Input pictures to be analyzed.
.VARI OUT
 Output pictures. OUT1 is the
 dark current picture. OUT2 is
 the optional slope picture.
.VARI SIZE
 Standard VICAR size field.
 See HELP SIZE.
.VARI EXPOSURE
 Exposure for each input 
 picture.
.VARI FORMAT
 FORMAT is ignored.
.VARI NEGATIVE
 Valid:('NEGATIVE) Specifies to
 output a negative DC picture.
.VARI MAXDN
 Specifies the maximum DN in 
 output pictures.
.VARI SCALE
 Slope picture is to be 
 multiplied by the given
 value.
.VARI X
 Value used to determine
 predicted
 Y value
.VARI CONS
 Constant to be added to
 deviated point.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
 INP=(IN1,IN2,...) where INn are file names of input pictures (up to ten) to be
   analyzed.  A minimum of two is required.
.VARI OUT
 OUT=(DC,SLOPE,YPOINT,DELTA) where DC, SLOPE, YPOINT, and DELTA represent
   output files names. DC is a required parmeter and is the dark current
   (or zero exposure intercept) picture. SLOPE is an optional file containing
   the slope picture. YPOINT is also an optional file containing the predicted
   Y value or what the DELTA file contains depending on if an X point is given.
   DELTA is an optional file containing the point deviating the most
   from the fitted line.
.VARI SIZE
 SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS) where SL, SS, NL, and NS are integer values specifying the 
   starting line, starting sample, number of line, and number of sample 
   respectively. The SIZE parameter has no real value for this program and may
   be omitted. 
.VARI EXPOSURE
 EXPO=(R1,R2,...) where Rn is a floating point number specifying the exposure
   for each of the input pictures. If the analyst is interested in only the
   dc picture or the relative slopes, the units of exposure are not important.
   There must be an equal number of values following EXPO as there are input
   pictures. There is no defaut. The exposure values must be in the same order
   as the input pictures.
.VARI FORMAT
 The format is obtained from the input image label. 
.VARI NEGATIVE
 Valid:('NEGATIVE) is a keyword specifying that the negative of the dc picture is to be
   outputted. The default is to output the positive picture.
.VARI MAXDN
 MAXDN=I1 where I1 is an integer value specifying that the maximum DN in the
   output pictures is equal to I1. The default is 255 for byte and 32767 for
   halfword picture.
.VARI SCALE
 SCALE=R1 where R1 is a floating point number specifying that the second 
   output (slope picture) is to be multiplied by R1. The default is 1.0.
.VARI X
 X=R2 where R2 is a floating point number that is used to calculate
   the predicted Y value.
.VARI CONS
 CONS=R3 where R3 is a floating point number that is used to calculate the
   point which diviates the most from the fitted line.
