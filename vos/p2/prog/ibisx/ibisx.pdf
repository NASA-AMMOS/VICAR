.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "ibisx"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   This program displays the contents of an IBIS file.  The display
mechanism was copied out of ibis-list and is similar to ibis-list.
Along with displaying the contents, ibisx will display the
statistics.  Only the data that is displayed are used to
calculate the statistics.


EXECUTION

   The program opens the ibis file, determines which rows should
be printed, prints the rows and calculates the statistics on the
rows that were printed.

EXAMPLES

   ibisx inp=x1 sr=2 nr=10

This command will display ibis file x1 starting at row 2 and
display 10 rows.

   ibisx inp=x1 skip=5 percent=10

This command will display every 5th element.  The total number
of displays will equal 10 percent of the number of rows.

   ibisx inp=x1 'random 'seed sr=5 nr=10

This command will randomly pick 10 rows but only that come after
row 5.

   ibisx inp=x1 'random percent=50

This command will randomly pick 50 percent of rows.

RESTRICTIONS

The size of image cannot be greater than 
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes.  64 bit long integer is
used to keep track of EOL label position.
