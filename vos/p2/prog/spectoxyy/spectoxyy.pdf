VICAR2 program "spectoxyy"

.help
PURPOSE
Spectoxyy converts up to 10 registered multispectral images taken through
narrow band filters and either in units of spectral radiance or in
units of spectral reflectance and converts these into three images
representing x and y chromaticity coordinates and Y tristimulus.

EXECUTION EXAMPLES:
spectoxyy inp=(in1,in2,in3,in4) out=(x,y,Y) +
  convert=(.0001,.0001,.0001,.0001) lamda=(460,540,590,630) +
  illumin=SUN mode=REFLECT
or
spectoxyy inp=(in1,in2,in3,in4) out=(x,y,Y,hist) +
  convert=(1.,1.,1.,1.) lamda=(460,540,590,630) +
  illumin=D65 mode=RADIANCE

Note: "hist" is a 2 dimensional histogram of the chromaticity space.
The x and y axes pass through (0,0) and the diagonal passes through 
(0,1) and (1,0). The enclosed triangle contains the valid chromaticity
space. Each pixel or bin contains the log of the accumulated counts
falling on that location. Horizontal is x and vertical is y.

THEORY:

Colorimetric units of xyY are obtainable from an input spectrum by
integrating the spectrum with color matching functions. 

If S is the radiance spectrum of the target,
   R is the reflectance spectrum of the target,
   I is the illuminating spectrum,
   Cx is the x color matching function, 
   Cy is the y color matching function, 
   Cz is the z color matching function, 

then one can compute tristimulus values Tx,Ty,Tz from:
   Tx=k*sum(S*Cx) radiance
   Ty=k*sum(S*Cy)
   Tz=k*sum(S*Cz)
or
   Tx=k*sum(R*I*Cx) reflectance
   Ty=k*sum(R*I*Cy)
   Tz=k*sum(R*I*Cz)

where k=100/sum(I*Cy)

Then x=Tx/(Tx+Ty+Tz)
     y=Ty/(Tx+Ty+Tz)
     Y=Ty

I is corrected for the distance of the target (RANGE keyword) from the sun
by dividing it by 1/(RANGE*RANGE), RANGE is in AU.
Notice that in reflectance mode the sun distance is ignored.

ILLUMINANTS:

You have a choice of two illuminants. These are:
1. D65 which represents a 
daylight spectrum on Earth with direct filtered sunlight and blue sky
scattering, and 
2. Unfiltered sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere.

With these you can reconstruct the color of a scene as it appears on Mars or
as it would appear on Earth (even if it isn't).

IMPLEMENTATION:

The program steps are as follows:

1. Reorder the input files into ascending wavelength order.
2. For each pixel:
3.	Compute the second derivative spline coefficients for interpolation.
4.	Loop on wavelength from 380 to 780 nm by 10 nm intervals.
5.		Interpolate spectrum amplitude.
6.		Integrate spectrum with color matching functions.
7.	Get x,y,Y
8.	Update 2-d chromaticity space histogram (option).
9. Write log of histogram.

Warning 1: There is no colorimetric absolute for Y tristimulus value.
Data typically ranges from 0 to 100, 100 being for a perfect Lambertian
surface. Calibrated devices expect
to see Y on the order of 10 to 90 or so. If your outputs for Y are wildly
far from this (like 20000 or .0003) then the display device cannot 
represent them. You can adjust your output using the CONVERT parameters, the
RANGE parameter, or just multiply the Y image by a constant. 

Warning 2: This program takes the highly unusual step of adjusting the D65
spectrum to match the solar spectrum above the atmosphere at the 780 nm
point. This is to help to get reasonable Y tristimulus values in the radiance
mode should you wish to use D65.

.level1
.vari INP
input image files
(3 to 10)

.vari OUT
output image files
(3 to 4)

.vari CONVERT
input image conversion factors
for radiance or reflectance.
Defaults to 1.0

.vari LAMDA
Wavelength of input
images in nanometers.
(ie: 556. for example)

.vari ILLUMIN
Illumination source
"D65" or "SUN"
Defaults to SUN

.vari MODE
Input image data.
"REFLECT" or "RADIANCE"
Defaults to RADIANCE

.vari RANGE
Range to the sun in AU.
Defaults to 1
Ignored in reflectance
mode.

.vari SOURCE
Illumination source
spectrum. Override
of ILLUMIN options.

.level2
.vari INP
INP = (input1,...,inputN), where the inputs are up to ten 
images in spectral radiance or spectral reflectance.  
The images must have been taken
with different filters and must all be the same size.

.vari OUT
Three output images in REAL format representing:
1. x chromaticity
2. y chromaticity
3. Y tristimulus
There is an optional fourth output file containing a 2-d histogram of
the chromaticity space. 

.vari CONVERT
Input image conversion factors for radiance or reflectance.
The input images are multiplied by these factors to convert them into
whatever units the software requires.
For reflectance images the software requires data from 0.0 to 1.0.
For radiance images the software requires data should be in units of 
Watts/meter**2/micron/srteradian and
should be numbers around 200 at 500 nanometers, if at an Earth distance.
CONVERT defaults to 1.0 for all inputs.

.vari LAMDA
Wavelength of the input images in nanometers.
(ie: 556. for example)

.vari ILLUMIN
Illumination source. Options are: "D65" or "SUN"
D65 represents daylight at average phase angles under the Earth's
atmosphere, including direst sunlight and blue sky scattering.
D65 is normalized to 100 at 560 nm.
SUN represents unfiltered sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere.
Defaults to SUN

.vari MODE
Input image data units. Options are: "REFLECT" or "RADIANCE"
Defaults to RADIANCE

.vari RANGE
Range to the sun in AU.
Defaults to 1
Ignored in reflectance mode.
Used to correct the illuminant ( D65 or SUN but not SOURCE) for the distance
to the sun in radiance mode only.

.vari SOURCE
Illumination source spectrum. One can override the provided  ILLUMIN options
with ones own spectrum. There must be 41 values beginning at 380 nm and 
ending at 780 nm.
