.TITLE
VICAR program MINFILT.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Selects the minimum DN within a rectangular convolution window for
images in BYTE, HALF, FULL or REAL formats.

.PAGE
EXECUTION:

MINFILT may be executed in the following manner:

		MINFILT INP=A OUT=B SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS) PARAMS

where INP, OUT, SIZE, AND PARAMS are parameters and are explained in their
respective parameter section.

.PAGE
OPERATION:

MINFILT finds the local minimum value of a rectangular window centered at
each pixel in an image. 
The program takes advantage of the fact that if the minimum of an area
was not in the left column then the next area to the right (one 
pixel over) need only be checked in the right column.

EXAMPLE:

	 MINFILT INP=A OUT=B NLW=5 NSW=7
  The window is 5 lines by 7 samples.

    May 18, 2011 - Ray Bambery - Mods for gcc4.4.4 64-bit and
                    add FULL and REAL data types, changed 
                    confusing NL & NS parms to ONL and ONS since
                    they refer to output file

    09-Jan-2013 -lwk- ONL and ONS commented out, since the code does
                      not use them.  (NL,NS are supposed to be alternatives
                      to the SIZE parameter.)

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
STRING-input dataset.
.VARI OUT
STRING-output dataset.
.VARI SIZE
4 INTEGERS-VICAR size field,
(SL,SS,NL,NS).
.VARI ONL
INTEGER-number of lines in
output file.
.VARI ONS
INTEGER-Number of samples in
output file.
.VARI NLW
INTEGER-Size of filter kernel
in lines.
.VARI NSW
INTEGER-Size of filter kernel
in samples.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
STRING - INP=A where A is the input dataset name.
.VARI OUT
STRING - OUT=B where B is the output dataset name.
.VARI SIZE
4 INTEGERS - SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS) where SL is the starting line, SS is the
 starting sample, NL is the number of lines in the input dataset and NS
 is the number of samples in the input dataset. (SIZE is usually defined
 as SIZE=(1,1,NL,NS)). Default is taken from the VICAR label within the
 program.
.VARI ONL
INTEGER - NL=N1 where is N1 is the number of lines in the output dataset.
.VARI ONS
INTEGER - NS=N1 where is N1 is the number of samples in the output dataset.
.VARI NLW
INTEGER - NLW=I1 where I1 is an integer and specifies the size of the filter
 kernel in lines. Default is NLW=3.
.VARI NSW
INTEGER - NSW=I2 where I2 is an integer and specifies the size of the filter
 kernel in samples. Default is NSW=3.
