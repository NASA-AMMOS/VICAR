.HELP
RESET takes an input which is a list of files in the format of
the output from the proc SRCH and resets the next file (the n in 
"NEXT FILE =     n", the first record) to the value specified by 
NEXTFILE, or 1 by default.  (This number is limited to 5 digits.)

REVISION HISTORY

  1986-08    SP  changed fscanf to sscanf and changed
                 format specifier from "%5d" to "10%d"
                 to allow users to modify the first record in file.
                 added code to check for first record having a
                 different length than expected and to handle this.
  1994-06    SVH Ported to UNIX - Steve Hwan
  2019-06-14 WLB IDS-7924: Made format string constant.
                 Cleaned up misc. warnings.
