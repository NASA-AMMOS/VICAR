.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program icat: cat 2 files vertically or horizontally
.HELP
PURPOSE

This is a quick and dirty replacement for ibis-cat which didn't work 
for long files possibly because of a long ascii column.  It cats the
two input files into the output.  The concatenation can be horizontal
or vertical using the keywords 'H or 'V.

For the vertical concatenation, the files must have the same columns
and column types.  For horizontal concatenation, the columns of the
second file are placed after the columns of the first.  If one file is
longer, zero or blank fill is added.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

	icat inp=(A,B) out=C 'h
or
	icat inp=(A,B) out=C 'v

OPERATION

RESTRICTIONS

For the vertical concatenation, the files must have the same columns
and column types.
