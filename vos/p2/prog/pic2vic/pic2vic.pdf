Converts PIC format images to VICAR
.HELP
Converts PIC formatted images to VICAR.  PIC is a trivially simple file format
used by the Robotics Group at JPL.  It consists of a 4-byte header with lines
and samples followed by image data.

PIC does not seem to support multi-band data.  However, the FIDO rover at
least uses it that way.  The BAND parameter can be used to select a band to
read.  No check is made that the band is present.  Data for each band simply
follows each other in the file with no intervening header.  There is also
no header to specify the number of bands (which is why it's not checked).

REVISION HISTORY
Date:                   March 18,1994
Cognizant Engineer:     S.V.Hwan
References:             PIC software, Todd Litwin, February 1993,
                        Caltech copyright (C) 1993
Modifications:
  1994-07-22 SVH - Moved PICS related routines to seperate file
  1994-09-05 MSTP - S/W Conversion (VICAR Porting)
  2000-09-28 RGD - Added BAND parameter
  2001-05-15 AXC - Modified pic_read.c routine to process multiband image
             on VMS system (AR-105427)
  2019-06-14 WLB - IDS-7924 - Fixed format directives
             Cleaned up misc. warnings
  2019-09-06 WLB - IDS-7922 - Initialized some variables.

.LEVEL1
.VARI PIC_INP
PIC format image file
.VARI OUT
VICAR output file
.VARI BAND
Starting band number to read
.VARI NBANDS
Number of bands to read
.LEVEL2
.VARI PIC_INP
This parameter specifies the complete path name
of the PIC format image file of one or more bands
to be converted to a single-band VICAR image.
.VARI OUT
This parameter specifies the complete path name
of the output VICAR compressed image.
.VARI BAND
Band number to read.  Specifying a band # too large will result in
an end of file error.  Bands start counting at 1.
.VARI NBANDS
Number of bands to read.  If (BAND-1) + NBANDS > # Band in Image,
then an error will occur.
