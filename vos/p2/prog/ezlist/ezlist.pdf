.TITLE
Similar to LIST, but output may be an ASCII text file
.HELP
PURPOSE
    EZLIST lists the contents of VICAR image files to ASCII text files.
    It is similar to LIST but the output may go to a text file and it 
    contains no headers at all.  Thus the ASCII output file is EZ (easy)
    for other programs to read.

EXECUTION

  ezlist I D.LIS FORMAT="(F8.3,2X)" 'W132 'INTEGER
       (Output goes to file named D.LIS.)
  ezlist I
       (Output goes to terminal screen.)

OPERATION
   The output floating point format can be specifed with the FORMAT parameter.
Each data element will have this format applied.  
This parameter is a string with a FORTRAN format specification (any legal
FORTRAN format specification is allowed).  The default format is F9.2,2X
which allows seven columns to be displayed (seven values per 80 character line.)

    If the trailing decimal point for a (Fn.0) format is not desired 
then the 'INTEGER keyword should be used.  This changes all decimal points
(periods) that are followed by a space into a space.  This is the way to
get the "integer" appearance for BYTE, HALF, or FULL data.

EZLIST supports all VICAR data formats.  All data is converted internally
to REAL format when it is read.

Each line of the file is converted to one line of output.  The output
file record length is approximately the FORMAT field with (plus spacing)
times the number of samples.
If no output file is specified, the output is written to the terminal screen
with lines TRUNCATED based on the WIDTH parameter.

RESTRICTIONS:
 1.  The maximum number of samples in the input file is 1024.
 2.  The SIZE field is not supported.  (If you want it, see Cognizant.)
     To run EZLIST on a window of a file, use COPY to copy the window to
     a temporary file.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
The input VICAR file.
.VARIABLE OUT
An (optional) output
file for the data.
.VARIABLE FORMAT
The FORTRAN floating point
format (e.g. "(F10.3,2X)")
.VARIABLE WIDTH
Specifies the width of the
terminal output in chars/line.
.VARIABLE DOTS
Specifies to change decimal 
points followed by spaces to 
spaces.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
STRING
The input VICAR file.
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - OPTIONAL
An output non-VICAR ASCII file for the data.
.VARIABLE FORMAT
STRING
The FORTRAN format statement syntax for the output (e.g. "(F10.3,2x)").
Only the floating point format syntax and 'x' syntax is allowed. 
No embedded blanks allowed in the string entered for this parameter.
EACH DATA ELEMENT WILL HAVE THIS FORMAT APPLIED.  That is, whatever the
user enters for FORMAT will be converted to NS(FORMAT) before processing
the records (where NS is the number of samples per line).
Examples:
	FORMAT="(F5.2)"
	FORMAT="F5.2"
	FORMAT="(2X,F5.2)"
.VARIABLE WIDTH
KEYWORD
Specification of the width of the terminal output.  File output is not
affected.
 W80 for 80 chars/line (default)
 W132 for 132 chars/line.
.VARIABLE DOTS
KEYWORD
 INTEGER to change decimal points followed by spaces to spaces.
 FLOATING to leave unchanged- default.
