!THIS IS A TEST OF MODULE FFT11
!THIS IS A FOUR PART TEST
!FIRST, THE TRANSFORM OF AN POWER-OF-TWO IMAGE IS CREATED AND CHECKED.
!SECOND, THE INVERSE TRANSFORM OF THE TRANSFORM IS CHECKED
!   FOR BEING IDENTICAL WITH THE ORIGINAL IMAGE.
!THIRD, REPEAT OF #1 WITH A NON-POWER-OF-TWO NUMBER OF SAMPLES.
!FOURTH, REPEAT OF #2 WITH AN IMAGE WITH NON-POWER-OF-TWO
!   NUMBER OF SAMPLES.
!MAKE AN IMAGE WITH # OF SAMPLES A POWER-OF-TWO
gen a nl=10 ns=32
!LIST PART OF THE ORIGINAL IMAGE
list a (1,1,10,10)
!NOW THE DIRECT TRANSFORM
fft11 a b
label-list b
list b (1,1,10,40) 'real4
!THE IBM ANSWER :
!  496. 0. -16. 162.45 -16. 80.437 ......
!  528. 0.  "     "	"    "
!  560. 0.  "     "	"    "
!    .
!    .
!    .
!NOW, THE INVERSE TRANSFORM
fft11 b c 'inve
label-list c
list c (1,1,10,10) 
!THESE NUMBERS SHOULD BE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL IMAGE
!NOW LETS DO A NON-POWER-OF-TWO IMAGE
gen a nl=10 ns=28
fft11 a b
label-list b
list b (1,1,10,40) 'real4
!THE IBM ANSWER :
!  417.  0. -86.59  131.23  -64.78  27.565 ......

!NOW, THE INVERSE TRANSFORM
