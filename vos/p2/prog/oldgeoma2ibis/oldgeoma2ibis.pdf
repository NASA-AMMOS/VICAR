.TITLE
Convert (obsolete) GEOMA parameters to IBIS format
.HELP
PURPOSE:

             GEOMA no longer supports a non-IBIS second input file.  
             Old non-IBIS 'GEOMA' files (which were often used to specify
             the geometric transformation needed to correct for camera
             distortion) can be converted on the VAX or Alpha using the program
             OLDGEOMA2IBIS.
             OLDGEOMA2IBIS converts an old non-portable (VMS) "geoma"
             file into an IBIS tiepoint file.  OLDGEOMA2IBIS runs only under
             VMS because it deals with a non-portable VMS-specific input file.

EXECUTION:

The following TAE command line formats show the most common usages:
      OLDGEOMA2IBIS INP=a OUT=b 
      OLDGEOMA2IBIS a b 

       Here 'a' represents the input old 'GEOMA' file.
       'b' represents an IBIS input file containing tiepoint information.

The input parameter dataset contains tiepoint parameters. This dataset must
have a standard VICAR label, and a record size of 3600. The first word of the
first record following the label is an integer specifying the number of
parameter words which follow. If one parameter record is not sufficient,
additional records may be used.

              old "geoma" files to IBIS tiepoint files.
