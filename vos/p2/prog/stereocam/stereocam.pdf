VICAR2 program stereocam

.HELP
Converts tiepoint locations to xyz coordinates for a stereo camera pair.

The coordinate system is cartesian and right handed. The uncommanded camera
points down the -Z axis. +X is to the right, +Y is up. The order of rotation
is:
First rotation about y (azimuth) positive to the left.
Second rotation about x (elevation) positive is up.
Third rotation about z (twist about optical axis) positive is counterclockwise.

Parameters permit you to position the camera in the unrotated initial
cartesian space and to rotate it about that point.
