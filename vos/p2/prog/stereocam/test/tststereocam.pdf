! 1=focal length in pixels
! 2=camera x location
! 3=camera y location
! 4=camera z location
! 5=first rotation degrees
! 6=second rotation degrees
! 7=third rotation degrees
! 8=sample of optical axis
! 9=line of optical axis
!The coordinate system is cartesian and right handed. 
!The uncommanded camera points down the -Z axis. 
!+X is to the right 
!+Y is up
