PURPOSE:

CCDRECIP determines the shutter offset (in msec) and sensitivity
(in DN per foot-lambert-milliseconds (UNITS = LUMINANC) or
in DN per picoamp-milliseconds (UNITS = RADIANCE)) for a
camera system.  The program is one of a series of programs originally
developed to support radiometric calibration of the Galileo SSI camera system.
(UNITS should be LUMINANCE for Galileo and RADIANCE for Cassini).

EXECUTION:
                CCDRECIP INP=RCP.DAT OUT=MARK.DAT PARAMS

The input is a Reciprocity File (RCP) containing statistical data for
specified areas in the image for each exposure of a reciprocity sequence.
The RCP must have been previously initialized via LTGEN and loaded with
data via MOMGEN.

The output is an optional MARK-format tiepoint data set containing the
centers of all areas rejected for producing values for SENSITIVITY or
SHUTTER OFFSET or either which differ by more than 2 sigma from the mean
values for all the areas.

.PAGE
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND:

The output camera signal is proportional to exposure as follows:

      DN-DC = A*L*(T-To)
where
      DN-DC is the output signal minus the dark current,
      A is the camera sensitivity (DN/foot-lambert-milliseconds (LUMINANC)) or
                                   DN/picoamp-milliseconds (RADIANCE))
      L is the light cannon setting (foot-lamberts (LUMINANC)) or
        is the spectral radiance of the source (picoamp (RADIANCE)),
      T is the commanded exposure time (milliseconds), and
      To is the shutter-offset (milliseconds).

CCDRECIP solves for the sensitivity A and shutter-offset To, given data
points DN acquired by varying the light cannon setting (or spectral radiance of
the source) and exposure time:
         i
                DN - DC = A*L *(T -To)
                  i          i   i

.PAGE
OPERATION:

CCDRECIP performs the following steps:

  1) Read data from the Reciprocity File.
  2) Compute the sensitivity and shutter offset for each area.
  3) Compute mean values for sensitivity and shutter-offset (by averaging
     the values extracted from each area) and flag all areas deviating
     by more than 1 or 2 sigma from the mean.
  4) Re-compute the mean value for sensitivity and shutter-offset,
     ignoring all flagged values as specified by the REJECT parameter.

If the REJECT parameter is specified (default=2), areas may be rejected
because of a bad value for sensitivity (REJECT=1), shutter-offset (REJECT=2),
or either (REJECT=3).  If REJECT=0, no area rejection is performed.

CCDRECIP prints out the following:

  1) Sensitivity and shutter-offset for each area.
  2) Summary of all areas with bad values for sensitivity or shutter-offset.
  3) Mean sensitivity as a function of exposure time.
  4) Global value for sensitivity and shutter-offset, obtained by combining
     data from all good areas.
  5) Shutter-offset as a function of image line or sample number.

Note that the sensitivity and offset are listed as AO and TOS in the printout.

If the PLOT keyword is specified, CCDRECIP produces the following plots:

  1) (DN-DC)/L vs SHUTTER TIME
  2) (DN-DC)/(L*T) vs SHUTTER TIME
  3) (DN-DC)/[L*(T-To)] vs SHUTTER TIME
  4) To vs image line or sample number.  The raw points are plotted with
     "+" and the average shutter offset at a given line or sample number
     is plotted as a solid line.

Four types of tabular output data are also available.  The AREATBL
parameter produces a tab-delimitted ASCII text file containing:
if UNITS = LUMINANC, MEAN_DN(D), LUM(L), EXP(T), L*T, ACTUAL(T-To), D/L,
D/L*T, and D/L*(T-To), and if UNITS = RADIANCE, MEAN_DN(D), RAD(L), EXP(T),
L*T, ACTUAL(T-To), D/L, D/L*T, and D/L*(T-To), for each exposure level.

The OFFTBL parameter produces a tab-delimitted ASCII text file containing:
LINE or SAMPLE and calculated SHUTTER_OFFSET for all good areas.

The AVOFFTBL parameter produces a tab-delimitted ASCII text file containing:
LINE or SAMPLE and mean SHUTTER_OFFSET for each row or column of grid areas.

The CORRTBL parameters produces two files tabulating the correction
achieved as a result of using the derived shutter-offset.  The first
of the two files holds the uncorrected sensitivity values averaged over
each column or row (see DIRECTIO parameter) of grid points.  The second
file holds the corrected values.  If DIRECTIO is LINE, then the values
of the grid rows are averaged.  If SAMP, then the values of the grid
columns are averaged.

If an output file is specified, the centers of all flagged areas (as
specified by the REJECT parameter) are stored in a MARK-format tiepoint
data set.  These areas can be subsequently displayed (see example below)
to indicate the spatial distribution of regions which give rise to bad
sensitivity or shutter-offset constants.

If an output shutter-offset file is specified via the OFFSET parameter,
then a file containing shutter offsets for each image line or sample is
generated.  These offsets are calculated by using the average shutter-offsets
as found above and then performing a piece-wise linear interpolation for the
lines or samples that fall between data points.  A linear extrapolation is
done at each end using the first and last two points.  These shutter-offsets
can later be used as inputs to GALGEN, see GALGEN's TUTOR and HELP files.

Instead of entering the light values of the exposure levels as a
multivalued parameter, they can be contained in an ASCII file.  This file
merely contains one light value per record (see procedure MOMGEN2 for
the format details).  The file is specified to CCDRECIP using the LTFILE
parameter.

NOTE:  The first value in the LIGHT parameter set or the LTFILE
       file should be 0.0 to correspond with EXPO=0.0 for the dark
       current frames.

The parameter DIRECTIO is used to tell CCDRECIP to derive a Line- or a
Sample-dependent shutter-offset.

Because CCDRECIP is dealing with the Light Transfer File and not the raw
images, it doesn't know how big they are.  Therefore, the user must tell
CCDRECIP how many elements the shutter-offset should contain.  This is
done with the ARRAYSIZ parameter.

NOTE:  CCDRECIP CANNOT be used with reciprocity sequences that contain
       extended dark current or extended exposure frames.

PLOT OUTPUTS

    The other type of output come from the PLOT and PLOTFMT parameters.
PLOT allows the user to display offset data in 4 formats on an x,y
plot using the gnuplot package after exiting the program. PLOT produces
a file of gnuplot commands contained in a file having a .gpi file extension.
Another file with an .asc extension is create containing columns of data
that are displayed by the gpi file.

   The PLOTFMT parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing PLOTFMT=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.

.PAGE

  PLOT NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the PLOT parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  PLOT=outplot
  then for the interactive plot the following files are produced:

     outplot.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot.      

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with PLOTFMT=eps
  then the following files are produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps

  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the plot command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  plot  'indata.dat.asc' u  1: 9 t .......

USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which are written out as a separate file. The plot is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the plot by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the plot by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the plot. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the plot to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the plot is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains columns of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions are discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the plot alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.

  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi

  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the plot).

  Note: This program creates 7 output plots per run. You bring up each plot
  panel sequentially. You close each plot by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the plot.


  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  plot suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy plot via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps
.PAGE
    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT plot library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages are used.
