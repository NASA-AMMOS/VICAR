VICAR1 Program TRISTIM
.HELP
"tristim" is a Vicar applications program that will calculate the tristimulus
values and chromaticity coordinates for a given spectrum, which may be of
intensity, reflectivity, or transmittivity. Tristimulus values and chromaticity
coordinates are quantities which must be known to do color reconstruction.  
For a complete discussion of colorimetry, see Reference 1.
 
EXECUTION:

tristim PARAMS

where PARAMS are parameters listed in Tutor mode.  (There are no input or
output datasets.)
.page
OPERATION:
 
"tristim" computes tristimulus values for a spectrum by the formulas:
 
  X = k * SUM( F(i) * x'(i) )
  Y = k * SUM( F(i) * y'(i) )
  Z = k * SUM( F(i) * z'(i) )
 
where:   X, Y, and Z are the tristimulus values,
 
         F is the input spectral distribution of intensity, reflectivity,
         or transmittivity.
 
         x', y', and z' are the C.I.E. standard colorimetric observer
         values, also known as the color matching functions, optionally
         weighted by a specified illuminant,
 
         and i is the wavelength.
 
The sums are taken from i = 380 nm to 770 nm.

The constant k is defined by the relation:

                    100
         k = -------------------
             SUM( S(i) * y'(i) )

         where S(i) is the spectral radiance of the illuminant.
 
For standard illuminants D55, D65, D75, A, B, and C, the color matching
functions have been weighted by the relative spectral power distributions
of these illuminants in such a way that k=1.  The XENON illuminant
weighting functions have also been computed so that k=1.  However, XENON
is not a standard of the C.I.E. and refers only to the JPL 12-inch light
cannon on 13 April 1976 (see Reference 2).
 
If the user is using some other illuminant, k will have to be computed
separately.  This can easily be done with another execution of TRISTIM,
inputting the spectral radiance of the illuminant for the 40 radiance
values, and then taking the ratio of 100 and the Y tristimulus value.
 
"tristim" also outputs the chromaticity coordinates of the spectrum in
question.  These are related by the equations:
 
          X                  Y                  Z
    x = ----- ,        y = ----- ,        z = ----- .
        X+Y+Z              X+Y+Z              X+Y+Z
.page
The user-supplied input spectrum (RADIANCE) may be specified as a multiple 
of up to ten separate spectral distributions, of exactly 40 points each 
(R1,...,R400). This can represent a series of filters through which light 
passes.
 
The RADIANCE values R1,...,R40 can also be modified (for whatever reason) 
by the equation:
 
   NEW_RADIANCE(i) = Ri * MULT + ADD

where MULT and ADD are the values specified for the parameters of those
names.
.page
In addition, the user may specify Continuum and Background spectra, CONTIN
and BACK, which will be applied to the input spectrum according to the
following formula:

                        (Ri - BACK(i))
   NEW_RADIANCE(i) = -------------------
                     (CONTIN(i) - BACK(i))

This can be useful to process spectrophotometric tracings of inputs in
certain colors and of a white reference input.

.vari illumin
ILLUMINANT: specifies the illuminant by whose spectral radiance the C.I.E.
color matching functions are weighted.
 
Valid values are: D55, D65, D75, A, B, C, XENON, CMF.
 
The first six of these (D55 thru C) are C.I.E. standard illuminants.
Note that D55, D65, and D75 refer to blackbody curves (Planck function)
at 5500, 6500, and 7500 Kelvins, respectively.

XENON specifies that the illuminant is the JPL 12-inch light cannon No. 1.
 
CMF specifies that the unweighted C.I.E. color matching functions are to be
used.
.vari radiance
RADIANCE:  List of numbers which specify the spectral radiance or reflectivity
or transmittivity of the object under study.  
 
This spectrum must be specified at exactly 40 points, starting at 380 nm 
and ending at 770 nm.  Up to 10 separate spectra may be specified, each of
40 points, which will be multiplied together inside the program to obtain
the final spectral distribution.  These separate spectra are simple entered
sequentially under this parameter.  E.g., if RADIANCE contains 80 numbers,
of which the first 40 are 2.0 and the next 40 are 5.0, then the resulting
spectrum values are 10.0 at all 40 points.
 
Note that the user may also cause a linear transformation to be applied to
the input spectrum, using the ADD and MULT parameters.
.vari add
ADD: This is a constant that will be added to each of the 40 spectral 
values specified by the RADIANCE parameter, before computing the tristimulus
values.
.vari mult
MULT: This is a constant that will be multiplied with each of the 40 spectral 
values specified by the RADIANCE parameter, before computing the tristimulus
values.
.vari contin
This specifies 40 points that will be used as a reference (continuum) spectrum
to compute relative radiance values from the values input in RADIANCE.

If this parameter is defaulted, then no relative radiance computation will
be done.
.vari back
This specifies 40 points that will be used a background spectrum if the
parameter CONTIN has been specified (if not, then this parameter is
ignored).

If only one value is specified, then that value will be used for all 40
points.
