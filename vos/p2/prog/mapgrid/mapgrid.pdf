.HELP
 PURPOSE:
 "MAPGRID" is a vicar applications program which will
 insert a reference grid into a picture.  The interval
 between lines of the grid is 25 pixels, and each grid
 line consists of alternating light and dark bars which
 are 1 pixel wide and 5 pixels long.
 Two modes exist for generating the DN intensities of
 the bars.  In the first, the light and dark bars
 alternate between intensities of 0 DN and 255 DN.
 In the second mode, the intensities of the bars are
 determined by adding a constant to and subtracting it
 from the corresponding pixel DN.  In this mode, every
 fourth grid line is emphasized by using twice the
 constant value in the additions and subtractions.

 EXECUTION:
   The following is the execution statement for MAPGRID
            MAPGRID  INP  OUT  PARAMS
 where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their
 respective parameter section in TUTOR mode.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
   input data set
.VARI OUT
   output data set
.VARI SIZE
   image size
.VARI BLAC
   black and white grid
.VARI MODU
   modulated grid
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
   input image file name
.VARI OUT
   Output image file name.  The output picture consists of the
   input with the appropriate grid patern superimposed.
.VARI SIZE
   (SL,SS,NL,NS)  SL and SS are, respectively the starting data
   record and starting byte in the input picture at which processing
   is to begin.  NL and NS are, respectively, the number of data
   record and the number of bytes to be processed from the input
   data set.  When the size field is defaulted, values for SL and
   SS of 1 will be assumed, and values for NL and NS will be assigned
   equal to the values in the input data set system label.  In this
   way,the output data will be equal in size to the input data.
.VARI BLAC
   This keyword causes a 0 DN and 255 DN grid pattern to be used.
.VARI MODU
   This keyword causes a modulated grid patern to be used with the
   specicied integer value.  The integer represents the constant for
   modulation.  If neither BLAC nor MODU is specified, the modulated
   grid patern is used with the integer value defaulted to 64.
