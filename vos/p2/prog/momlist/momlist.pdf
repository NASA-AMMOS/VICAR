PURPOSE:

MOMLIST extracts the light transfer data from Light Transfer and 
Reciprocity files made by MOMGEN.

The input is a Light Transfer File (LTF) containing statistical data for
specified areas in the image for each exposure of a light transfer
sequence.  The LTF must have been previously initialized via LTGEN and
loaded with data via MOMGEN.

If an output file is specified for the TABLE parameter, an ASCII file of
tab-delimitted text is output.  This file will contain a tabular list of the
area, exposure time, mean DN and sigma for the area specified.

   MOMLIST LTF.DAT TABLE=A5.TBL AREA=5
