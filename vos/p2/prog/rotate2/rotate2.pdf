vicar Program ROTATE2
.help
PURPOSE:

ROTATE2 will compute the geometric transformation parameters for rotating a 
picture by any amount about a specified point.

OPERATION:

ROTATE2 cannot called directly by the user since the rotate2 program is
used only to create a parameter data set for input to LGEOM. The parameter
data set's name is given by the PDS parameter. The parameter data
set has a vicar label of 1 line by 512 bytes.

Rotate2 is normally called by the procedure ROTATE which uses the 
parameter data set as an input to LGEOM which does the rotation.

The rotation is about an axis normal to the picture and intersecting it at
the specified pixel center of rotation.

The size field should take into account any increase in the number 
of lines and samples due to the rotation.

EXECUTION:

   For the typical usage, see the HELP for procedure ROTATE.

   The following is the execution statement format for ROTATE2:
        rotate2 inp  params
   where INP,  and PARAMS    are parameters discussed in their
   respective sections.

EXAMPLES:

1) rotate2 IN par size=(1,1,100,160) line=15. samp=35. angl=24.2
----This example will set up to rotate the 100x160 sample file by 24.2 degrees
    about the pixel at line 15 and sample 35.

2) rotate2 IN par size=(1,1,100,160) angl=24.2
----This example does the same but about the center of the picture.

3) rotate2 IN par angl=-1. center=(50.,30.)
----This example will set up to  rotate IN by -1. degrees about its center and
    translate the rotated picture so that the center of rotation in the 
    output occupies line 50, sample 30.

 LIMITATIONS:

  1. The input file must be either BYTE or HALFWORD.

 REVISION HISTORY
  1993-06-08 SP  Made portable for UNIX.
  2011-04-10 RJB Changed qprint call to xvmessage due to message: 
        [TAE-PRCSTRM] Abnormal process termination; process status code = 11.;
  2013-01-09 LWK Fixed OUT1/OUT2 assignments due to different behaviour
                 with the -e compiler flag on Solaris
  2013-09-02 RJB Update documentation and test procedure.
  2015-12-16 WLB Merged LWK's and RJB's changes. Migrated to MIPL.

.level1
.vari inp
The data file to be rotated.
.vari pds
The output parameter data set.
.vari size
The area to be rotated.
.vari sl
The starting line of the size 
field.
.vari ss
The starting  sample of the 
size field.
.vari nl
The number of lines in the 
size field.
.vari ns 
The number of samples in the 
size field.
.vari angle
Amount of rotation in degrees.
.vari line
The line number of the center 
of rotation.
.vari sample
The sample of the center of 
rotation.
.vari center
The location of the 
output center of rotation.
.vari nointerp
Indicates no interpolation.
.level2
.vari inp
A VICAR labelled image to be rotated.
.vari pds
An output file of GEOM parameters in "parms" format.  See LGEOM or MGEOM 
documentation.  (The default for this parameter data set is a temporary file 
with the name ZZPAR)
.vari size
The size field indicates which area of the input image is to be 
rotated.  The NL and NS parameters specify the size of the output image.
.vari sl
The starting line of the size field.
.vari ss
The starting sample of the size field.
.vari nl
The number of lines in the size field.  Also, the number of lines in the
output image.
.vari ns
The number of bytes in the size field.  Also, the number of bytes in the 
output image.
.vari angle
This specifies the number of degrees clockwise from up to rotate the image. 
May be positive or negative. 
Default = 0.
.vari line
This is the line number of the center of rotation in the input image.
Default = .5 * (sl + nl) ...the center line of the picture.
.vari sample
This is the sample number of the center of rotation in the input image.
Default = .5 * (ss + ns) ...the center sample of the picture.  Values are
in samples, not bytes.
.vari center
This specifies the center of rotation in the output image.  Default is the 
same as that specified for or defaulted for the input image.  (Note that the
sample values are expressed in units of pixels, not bytes.)
.vari nointerp
This specifies that no interpolation is to be performed during the GEOM.
In this case, the DN value of the point closest to the fractional line and
sample is used.  This method ("nearest neighbor") is somewhat faster, but is
not as accurate as the four point interpolation.  Default = NOINTERP.
