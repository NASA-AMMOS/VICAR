.TITLE
ibis2rpc - Place IBIS file version of RPC's back into image label
.HELP
PURPOSE
     The IBIS file version of RPC's can be put into a tiny 1 x 1 image with
     this routine.  They will be in the GeoTIFF property label.  Then, they
     can be merged into a real RPC/GeoTIFF image with the routine GTGENUP.
	   
CALL
     ibis2rpc INP OUT CCOL=C1 SCOL=C2
  WHERE:
     INP          is the 80 record ibis file with RPC's
     OUT          is a VICAR GeoTIFF image (1 pixel) with RPC's in the label
     CCOL         is the column in the INP file with the RPC coefficients
     SCOL         is the column in the INP file with the RPC scales and offsets, etc
     
OPERATION

A one pixel image is generated.  The label items are read from the IBIS file and put
into the label of the generated image.

PERFORMANCE

Less than 10 seconds.
