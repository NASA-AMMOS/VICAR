Name of Program:	TPHOPDF
	
PURPOSE:	TPHOPDF tests and demonstrates the usage of menu-driven 
		input of photometric and other grouped parameters.
	
FUNCTION:

TPHOPDF is a program to test and demonstrate the usage of menu-driven input of 
the large number of different PDF parameters related to photometric calculus 
into the main program (including their various permitted ranges and default 
settings).  

The MDF is used to organize PDF parameters into different "menus".  The goal of 
such menus is to organize input parameters into parameter groups related to 
specific topics (e.g. I/O-parameters, photometric parameters, SPICE parameters)
in order to facilitate the preparation and the execution of a program to the 
user.

This programs uses most of the sub PDFs delivered by the PHOPDF.COM.  

This testo program shows to the software user how to
	-navigate through a menu;
	-switch between the interactive operation modes of TAE (i.e. Command  
	  Line Mode [TCL], Tutor Mode, and Menu Mode);
	-save the parameter set for later re-processing;
	-delete temporary parameter files.

This program demonstrates to the software developer how to
	-integrate the sub PDFs of PHOPDF into their main program
	-set the different defaults for parameters (with different or the same 
	  name) related to different photometric functions for a tutor-session 
	  or the batch mode;

The programmers are welcome to cut out and vary the tphopdf.pdf 
tphopdf_general.pdf, tphopdf_spice.pdf and the tphopdf.pdf for use 
in their own programs using other defaults, additional parameters, and 
different or additional submenues (see also the demonstration program PHODEM). 
But be carefully for creating names for global variables, because these global
defintions are for the hole VICAR-session.  Note that the default values of the 
sub-PDF's (e.g. of the photometry menus from PHOPDF) will be overwritten by 
the default values of the main-pdf (in this case by TPHOPDF.PDF).

TPHOPDF simulates a program to read the parameters from an IBIS2 parameter file 
(see the pho_par_file package) and for reading MARS94/96-SPICE informations. 
However, this is just a simulation.  There is no real IBIS2-processing nor real 
SPICE reading done in this demo!


EXECUTION:

There are separate PDFs for each selection point seen in the main menu.  On 
selection of a particular menu point you will enter the normal tutor mode of 
this PDF.  In this demo program, the menu points have the following 
(dummy/simulated!) meanings:

1. Select the first menu point to input the general parameters for a program
   such as the names of input/output images, the illumination conditions, and 
   so on.
2. In the second menu point you can input (dummy) parameters
   related to SPICE (navigation data, pointing data, instrument data, etc.)
3. In this case, the PDF pertaining to this menu point and the name of this 
   menu point are changing depending on your input of the parameter PHO_FUNC
   in the first menu point.
   There are a few special entries of this parameter:
   - to run the program without using a photometric function you have
     to select PHO_FUNC = "NONE",
   - to read in the photometric function and its associated parameters from a 
     photometric parameter IBIS2-file you have to select PHO_FUNC = "PAR_FILE", 
     and
   - to enter photometry parameters by yourself using the tutor mode
     you have to select the desired photometric function.
4. Select this menu point to specify the name of the parameter file which is 
   generated by the program (the default name in VICAR programs: LAST.PAR).
   This is useful because in a Menu there is no 'save'-command to save a 
   parameter file with a user-specified name (e.g. "save proc_name.par").

   EXECUTION :

   USER ACTION				RESULT

   don't call this menu point		last.par

   exit this menu point with 'exit'	last.par

   exit this menu point with 'run'	the user-specified name or the 'name 
					of the application procedure .par' as 
					it is given by the parameter 'save_par'
5. This menu point is to be entered to execute the main program.

You can repeat all steps and reenter all menu items except the step that leads 
to the execution of the program.

If you request help for the selection points in the Menu, you will get the help 
text contained in the respective sub PDFs.


HELPS :

- You will get the common help contained in the ".mdf" file (tphopdf.mdf) by 
  typing "help *" in the menu,
- but you will get the help text contained in programs main-PDF (tphopdf.pdf)  
  by processing of "help-help" applied to the program (should be verry 
  similary).
- If you request help for the selection points in the Menu, you will get the 
  help text contained in the respective sub PDFs.



OPERATION:

Although the main purpose of this program is to test and demonstrate the use of 
menus in VICAR programs, the main part of the test program TPDOPDF actually
- reads in the photometric parameters and the illumination conditions,
- computes the bidirectional reflectance, the photometric function and the 
  photometric correction factor to change radiance values from measured viewing 
  and illumination conditions to new artificial target viewing and illumination 
  conditions.  

No image processing is being done.  Results are written to the screen.

				Minnaert photometric function.

A_VEVERKA	real		Parameter of the Veverka, Squyres-Veverka

				of opposition surge due to shadowing).

B_SHOE		real		One of the classical Hapke parameter.
				Opposition magnitude coefficient. The total 
				amplitude of the opposition surge due to 
				shadowing. It  is the ratio of the light 
				scattered from near the illuminated surface of 
				the particle to the total amount of light 
				scattered at zero phase :
				B_SHOE=S(0)/(W_SOIL*p(0))
					with p(0) - soil phase function
					S(0) - opposition surge amplitude 
					       term which characterizes the 
					       contribution of light scattered 
					       from near the front surface of 
					       individual particles at zero 
						phase.
				For a true, shadow-hiding opposition effect, 
				0<=B_SHOE<=1.
				However, there are several other phenomena that 
				may also cause a surge in brightness at small 
				phase angles. T
				These including the folllowing:
				1) The coherent backscatter or weak photon 
				   localisation due to multiply scattered light.
				2) An single-particle opposition effect caused 
				   by complex porous agglomerates (soil phase 
				   function )
				3) Glory caused by sperical particles ( soil 
				   phase function )
				4) Internal reflections of transparent particles
				   ( soil phase function )
   				These various phenomena may be large enough to 
				increase the opposition surge by more than a 
				factor of 2. This possibility may be taken into 
				account by allowing B_SHOE to be greater than 1.

H_CBOE		real		Parameter of the coherent backscattering 
				( angular width of the opposition surge due to 
				multiply scattered light):
				H_CBOE=lambda/(2*pi*L)
					lambda - wavelength
					L - the free path of the phonon in the 
					    medium

				backscattering (height of opposition surge due 
				to multiply scattered light).

				Mode.
