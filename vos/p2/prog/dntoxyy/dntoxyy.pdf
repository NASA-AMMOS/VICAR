VICAR program DNTOXYY

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To generate xyY images (chromaticity x and y and tristimulus Y) from
unknown input multispectral imagery where the scenes contain known
colors. Use this program if the images are not in radiance units or
the bands are outside the visible or of unknown wavelength. If you
know these things then use spectoxyy instead. Once xyY images exist 
they can be converted to rgb for a particular device using xyytospec
or xyy2hdtv.

METHOD:
This method solves for a linear relation between input dn and XYY
tristimulus values. You specify the xyY's and dn's of special colors in the
scene and a solution is made for the C's from the simultaneous
equations:
X(color1)=C1*dn(color1,band1)+C2*dn(color1,band2),...
X(color2)=C1*dn(color2,band1)+C2*dn(color2,band2),...
..etc..
This is done three times once for X, then Y, and then Z.
Once the C's are known you can substitute any input dn's to derive
the corresponding tristimulus values XYZ. The XYZ's are converted to
xyY's and written out.

All color data are input either after the keyword COLORS or after the
keyword MACBETH. These are the only mechanisms for inputting colors. Each time
you use these keywords the program writes a color calibration file called:
color_calibration.txt. Once this file exists you can cause the program to
read it for processing other images by running dntoxyy without any parameters.
See the example below.

WARNING: If you read a color calibration file your images must retain the same
order and gains as the images from which the file was created.

EXECUTION:

To process images and to create a calibration file:

dntoxyy inp=(band1,band2,...bandn) out=(x,y,Y) colors=(...)
xyy2hdtv inp=(x,y,Y) out=(r,g,b)
or
dntoxyy inp=(band1,band2,...bandn) out=(x,y,Y) macbeth=(...)
xyy2hdtv inp=(x,y,Y) out=(r,g,b)

To process images using an existing calibration file:

dntoxyy inp=(band1,band2,...bandn) out=(x,y,Y)
xyy2hdtv inp=(x,y,Y) out=(r,g,b)

COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  Jean Lorre

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
N input images

.VARI OUT
3 Output images

.VARI COLORS
Color coordinates
and dn values.

.VARI WEIGHTS
Priorities of the
colors.

.VARI MACBETH
Location of
macbeth chart.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Up to 10 multispectral registered input images.

.VARI OUT
Three Output REAL images in the order:
x    x chromaticity.
y    y chromaticity.
Y    Y tristimulus.

.VARI COLORS
(Only required to create a new color calibration file.)
Colors of the known reference colors.
We list here all data for all the reference colors strung out in a long
list from color 1 to color M. Each color must contain (in this order):
1. x chromaticity in D65 (0 to 1.0).
2. y chromaticity in D65.(0 to 1.0).
3. Y tristimulus in D65. (0 to 100.0).
4. DN of this color in input image 1.
5. DN of this color in input image 2.   
6. .....etc....
 . DN of this color in last input image.
Repeat above for each reference color.
The number of reference colors must exceed the number of input images by 
at least 1. If COLORS is specified the MACBETH keyword is not required.

.VARI WEIGHTS
(Optional)
A table of the weights (priorities) of each color for the least squares fit.
The default is 1.0 for each color. If WEIGHTS is specified you must list a
weight for each color. If MACBETH is specified there are 24 colors.

.VARI MACBETH
(Only required to create a new color calibration file.)
The image location of the macbeth chart.
There are 8 input numbers in the order line,sample,line,sample,...
These are, in input order, the image coordinates of the centers of the upper
left, upper right, lower left, & lower right patches on the macbeth color
chart. The chart is oriented with the gray row at the bottom.
 With this information the program will go to the images and extract the
dn values for each of the 24 macbeth color patches. The program already knows
the Macbeth D65 colors. If MACBETH is specified the COLORS keyword is not
required.
NOTE: The coordinates are the image locations of the CENTERS of the corner 
patches.
