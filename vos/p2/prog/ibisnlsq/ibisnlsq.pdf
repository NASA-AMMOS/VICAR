.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "ibisnlsq"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   "ibisnlsq" performs non-linear least squares fits on data in
an IBIS interface (tabular) file.  The solutions and/or residuals
can be placed in specified columns of the file.  The solutions can
also be output to the terminal.  Multiple fits can be done on
different parts of one file.

The actual non-linear function has to be written by the user and
compiled into the program (see al zobrist or cognizant programmer).
A program for the partial derivatives of the non-linear function
with respect to each of the parameters also has to be written and
compiled in.  As an alternative, the user can make his/her own copy
of this program and add a function, or even substitute a function
for one of the existing functions.  Note that there is also a 
combined function that simply calls the function and the derivative
function.

The solcol applies to the second ibis file. The first column is the
solution "guess".  The routine uses a type of multidimensional
Newton's method and starts from a guess and does better
with a good guess.  In the case where there are multiple solutions, a
good guess may be necessary to find the correct solution and possibly
also to get convergent behavior.  The final solution is output to the
second column named in solcol.  The remaining columns are for testing
purposes and check the solution, the sigmas, and the total least squares.
See the Kirby2 test case in tstibisnlsq.pdf for a demo.

The coefficients in the solution may be a subset of the coefficients in
the guess column.  This is useful for the RPF cases, see especially
RPC10N and RPC10D.  The user must then program for transfers from the
coefficient vector to the guess vector in three places:

1.  Setting up the guess vector in the main program.
2.  Calculating the derivatives in the derivative program.
3.  Transferring one solution step in the subroutine TEST_FDF.

The RPC functions:"RPCD20","RPCD19","RPCD10","RPCD9","RPCN20","RPCN10",
 "RPC39","RPCTEST","RPCNZT","RPCDZT","RPCNZ2","RPCDZ2"

NOTE -- MOST OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT RECOMMENDED.
THE NUMERATOR FUNCTIONS ARE ACTUALLY LINEAR AND CAN USE IBISLSQF
SO THE MOST USEFUL IS RPCD19

RPCD20 - solves for the 20 denominator coefficients, the user must
         normalize the first to 1.0 when all solving is done
RPCD19 - solves for the 19 denominator coefficients, the first (1.0)
         is left alone
RPCN20 - solves for the 20 numerator coefficients
RPCD10 - solves for the 10 denominator coefficients not involving
         the Height term, the user must normalize the first to 1.0
         when all solving is done
RPCD9  - solves for the 9 denominator coefficients not involving
         the Height term, the first (1.0) is left alone
RPCN10 - solves for the 10 numerator coefficients not involving
         the Height term
RPC39  - solves for all 39 coefficients, experimental, not recommended
RPCDZT - solves for the 10 denominator coefficients that involve Height
         holding the x,y terms constant, the denominator constant also
         varies and must be normalized to 1.0
RPCNZT - solves for the 10 numerator coefficients that involve Height
         holding the x,y terms constant, the numerator constant also
         varies
RPCDZ2 - solves for the denominator H coefficient that involve Height
         holding all other terms constant, the denominator constant also
         varies and must be normalized to 1.0
RPCNZ2 - solves for the numerator H coefficient that involve Height
         holding all other terms constant, the numerator constant also
         varies

EXECUTION

     ibisnlsq INP=(DATA,GUESS) FUNC=KIRBY2 DATACOL=1 DEPCOL=4 CONCOL=7 +
	     RESCOL=8  COEFFCOL=(21,22,23,24,25) 'NOPRINT SOLCOL=(1,2,3,4,5)

    This example shows the use of all of the parameters.  The input
file, DATA.INT, is an IBIS interface file.  The data for the independent
variables is in columns 1 and the data for the dependent 
variables are in column 4.  The control column 7 is used for
multiple fits to be done in one run.  The least square fits are done 
on sets of rows; a new set is started whenever the value in the control 
column changes.  If no control column is specified then one fit
is done on the whole file.  The COEFFCOL and RESCOL parameters specify
in which columns, of the input file, the results will be put.  If either
or both are not specified then they will not be output.  There must be
as many coefficient columns as there are independent columns and these
match the sequence of the independent variable columns.  The
coefficients of the solution are placed in columns 21,22,23,24,25.  The
residual column can be used to easily calculate the deviation of the
data points from the fitted line. Normally the solution for each set
is printed to the terminal, but this can be turned off with the
'NOPRINT keyword.  The second input file is an IBIS interface file contain-
ing the guess in column 1, solution output into column 2, and testing values
in the other three columns.

    The length of each set should, of course, be longer than the
number of independent variables (columns).  If it is not then the
routine will still probably find a feasible solution (usually not unique)
and go on.


RESTRICTIONS

The maximum number of independent columns (variables) is 20.  Note
that all of the RPC routines use 3.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
   INP=(file,file2)   Input IBIS interface file for data, and guess-solution
.VARIABLE DATACOL
   DATACOL=(N1,...,Nj) The   integers   N1,...,Nj  specify   the 
                      columns  which contain the data  for  the 
                      non-linear function.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE DEPCOL
   DEPCOL=M1          The integer M1  specifies   the columns
                      which contain the data  for  the 
                      dependent variable.  Each row contains 
                      one data point.

.VARIABLE COEFFCOL
   COEFFCOL=(N1,...,Nk) The   integers   N1,...,Nk  specify   the 
                      columns  which will receive the coefficients
                      of the solution for use in applying to
                      other operations in the IBIS file (for example
                      a slope or trend of some data points can be
                      found and the slope can be applied to other
                      data).  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.
		      
		      Note that there is a lot of repetition of the
		      coefficients in the columns, but this allows
		      the coefficients to be used in a row-oriented
		      arithmetic operation by routine MF.

.VARIABLE RESCOL
   RESCOL=R1          The  integer R1 specifies the  column which 
                      will  receive the residuals corresponding 
		      to the dependent variables for each data
		      point.  If this parameter is omitted,  
		      then no residuals are stored.
.VARIABLE CONCOL
   CONCOL=C           The integer C specifies a control column 
                      which produces a separate fit for each 
                      group of identical numbers in the control 
                      column.  If this keyword is omitted, then

                      squares fit.
