.TITLE
VICAR2 program SPICE

.HELP
SPICE lists all the information available on an image from any
flight project. This includes the SPICE/SEDR and the image labels.
The program also acts as a test for the following subroutines.
The output of each will be listed under that routines heading:
GETPLACON
GETCAMCON
GETSPICE
GETPROJ
GETGEOM
GETLABCON
CONVISOS

PARAMETERS:

SPICEMODE specifies whether local or remote SPICE access is to be used.
If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value of the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE.


PARAMETERS FOR RETRIEVING THE INITIAL CAMERA POINTING:

Initial camera pointing data is first retrieved from predict C kernels or
from MIPS C kernels.  The following optional parameters permit the user to
specify where this initial pointing is retrieved:

CKNAME and CKID are alternative ways to specify the C kernel from which camera
pointing is to be retrieved.  For example, CKNAME=FARE or CKID=M904 specifies
that the camera pointing should be retrieved from the file MIPS_FARENC.CK.
The CKID is the unique kernel ID assigned to each C kernel.  When CKID is
specified, it overrides the CKNAME parameter.  A complete list
of kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or
environmental variable) KERNELDB.


PARAMETERS FOR STORING THE IMPROVED CAMERA POINTING:

The following optional parameters are used to store provenance information along
with the improved (C-Smithed) camera pointing computed by the program.  This
provenance information is stored in the (C kernel) segment identifier for the
camera pointing data.  In cases where there are several versions of camera
pointing for an image in a given C kernel, this provenance information can
later be used to retrieve a specific instance of camera pointing from the
kernel.

PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode) for further details.

Examples:  'LOCAL CKNAME=NAIF specifies that SPICE data be retrieved from
          local kernels using camera pointing from predicts or AACS telemetry.
          Improved camera pointing will later be stored in the local C kernel
          specific to this program.

           'REMOTE INSTITUTE=DLR USERID=TYR retrieves SPICE data remotely
          (from MIPS) via the SPICE server.  When improved camera pointing is
          stored (at MIPS), provenance data regarding the facility (DLR) and
          user (Thomas Roatsch) who created the data is included.

.VARI UPDATE
To update the SEDR/SPICE
with subroutine PUTSPICE

.VARI DESTINATION
The name to be associate 
with the SEDR/SPICE


.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
There are up to 2 input files:
1. The image whose label and spice/sedr to list.
2. The geom correction file for the first input.
   The second file is optional. If not included,
   nominals will be generated.

.VARI UPDATE
To update the SEDR or SPICE
Specifies whether subroutine PUTSPICE is to be called.
The default (NOUPDATE) is to NOT call PUTSPICE.
Note that the sedr/spice will be updated with the
source specified by the DESTINATION keyword .

.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  If defaulted, the target
name is extracted from the VICAR label or determined by other TBD means.

A complete list of valid target names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.  Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode,
the other mode is attempted.

.VARI CKNAME
CKNAME is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used:

  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  --------      -------------
  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  NAIF		the best NAIF kernel is used

If defaulted, the kernels are searched in the above order.

.VARI CKID
CKID is an alternative way to specify the prefered C-kernel (see CKNAME
parameter):

  CKID	  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  ----	  --------      -------------
  M906	  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  M905	  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  M904	  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  M903	  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  M902	  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  M901	  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  varies  NAIF		there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, CKID overrides the CKNAME parameter.

.VARI USERID
USERID is a three character string which identifies the user who created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  USERID=HBM identifies Helen Mortensen as the creator of the camera
     pointing.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group which created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which created
the camera pointing.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=MIPS specifies that MIPS created the camera pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI PROGRAM
PROGRAM is the first six characters of the program creating the camera pointing.

Ex:  PROGRAM=FARENC specifies that FARENC created the camera pointing.

.VARI SPKID
SPKID specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
SP kernel used to create the camera pointing.  The SP-kernel IDs are located
in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable)
KERNELDB.

Ex:  SPKID=N015 specifies the SP kernel GLL_LONG_2.BSP

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.

Ex:  REQNUM=3456 identifies (somewhat) request number R123456

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.

.VARI DESTINAT
Destination is the name to be associated with the
SEDR/SPICE as a source when it is updated. Only required if
the UPDATE keyword is specified.
