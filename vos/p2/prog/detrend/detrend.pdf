VICAR program detrend

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Fit a polynomial surface to a 2D raster (i.e., an image usually) and remove the
fitted surface from the image. This is used to "detrend" an image. A typical 
application is to remove pixel offsets and long wavelength distortion from a
disparity maps when simple f2 math doesn't do it.

Using FULL param it is possible to only return the fitted surface and not 
substract it from the image.

Because spurious measurements could bias the fit, an iterative process is 
available to minimize outliers effects. See more details in the description
of ITER and SCALING.

The polynomial surface fit uses a function of this form:
   Z = f(X,Y) =  k0 + k1*X + k2*X^2 + ... +km*Y + kn*XY + ko*X^2Y +...
with f(X,Y) being the surface elevation value (Z) of the points and (X, Y) 
the planar coordinates of the points.
The degree of the polynomial function is defined with DEGREE and represents
the  maximum degree of X and Y combined:
DEGREE=0: f(X,Y) = k0    i.e., an offset 
DEGREE=1: f(X,Y) = k0 + k1*X + k2*Y    i.e., a plane
DEGREE=2: f(X,Y) = k0 + k1*X + k2*X^2 + k3*Y + k4*X*Y + k5*Y^2   i.e., a 2nd
          order polynomial
DEGREE=3: f(X,Y) = k0 + k1*X + k2*X^2 + k3*X^3 + k4*Y + k5*X*Y + k6*X^2*Y
                   + k7*Y^2 + k8*X*Y^2 + k9*Y^3  i.e., a 3rd order polynomial
// etc...


EXECUTION:
detrend inp=disp.img out=detrended.img

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input image

.VARI OUT
Output image

.VARI MASK_FIT
Output fit mask

.VARI BAND
Band to detrend

.VARI DEGREE
Polynomial fit degree

.VARI SKIP
How many pixel to skip 
between input

.VARI NOVAL
Pixel value to ignore

.VARI ITER
Number of surface fit
iterations

.VARI SCALING
scaling factor for
outliers detection

.VARI FULL
Only compute the

.VARI FILL_SURFACE
Leave or not hole in the
computed surface

.VARI OMP_ON
Turns on or off parallel
processing (default: on)

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
input image. Can be multi-band.

.VARI OUT
Output image. Name of the output image, that is, the input image for which a 
polynomial surface has been fitted on and removed.

.VARI MASK_FIT
Output a mask file that will identify the pixels that satisfy the final (last 
iteration) fit within SCALING tolerance. Note that due to the iterative process,
some pixels that might have been discarded during early iterations might satisfy
the final fit tolerance, depending on where the fit converges to. The output 
file will reflect which INP pixels satisfy the final fit tolerance, and not 
which pixels were used to define the last iteration fit.

.VARI BAND
Band of input image to process. 1-based.
If set to 0, all bands are processed and the output image will have the same
number of bands as the input image.

.VARI DEGREE
Maximum degree number of the polynomial, combining x and y degree. For instance,
if DEGREE = 2, then the polynomial surface will have this form:
f(x,y) = k0 + k1*X + k2*X^2 + k3*Y + k4*XY + k5*Y^2
Default is 2.

.VARI SKIP
When doing the fit, if all the pixels of the image are taken to define the 
coefficients of the polynomial surface, this can lead to long processing time
and possibly crash. This is due to the involvment of large matrix construction
and inversion. Instead of taking all pixels of the image, the image is 
subset by taking every other SKIP pixels. Default is 10, that is, only every 
other 10 pixels in line and sample direction will be used for the fit.
However, once the coefficients are defined, the correction is applied to all
pixels.

.VARI NOVAL
All pixels which have a value equals to NOVAL are not considered. They are not
part of the surface definition, and their values are left untouched in the 
output image. Default is 0.0, which is the sort-of-assumed missing value in
vicar images.

.VARI ITER
Number of iterations the surface fit is going to be done, for each band.
Default is 1, which corresponds to only one fit done (no filtering of ouliers
as explained below).
Some of the pixels which are selected for defining the surface fit could be
outliers, which could bias the surface. In order to mitigate the bias, the 
fitting process can be iterated a number of times, with outliers being removed 
between iterations. The process is as follow:
- An initial list-of-pixels is selected based on SKIP.
- do ITER time:
-- fit a surface using the list-of-pixels
-- get the std dev of misfit, i.e., the std deviation of all pixel residual 
   between the pixel value and the fitted surface value at that pixel
-- remove from list-of-pixels the ones whose mis-fit is greater than std dev of 
   misfit scaled by SCALING.
- end do
It is important that ITER should not be large, because, once the outliers are 
removed (in the 1-2 first iterations usually), this approach will start 
discarding valid pixels. Usually ITER=2 gives reasonable results if an iterative
process is needed.

.VARI SCALING
(See ITER for context) Scaling factor to apply to the std deviation of residual. 
The larger the scaling, the larger the misfit has to be to remove a pixel from
the list. In pseudo-pseudo-code we have:
threshold = stdevMisfit * SCALING
for all pixels, if misfit of pixel > threshold --> remove pixel from list

.VARI FULL
If set to SURFACE_ONLY, the program will output the computed polynomial surface
but won't correct the INP. If set to FULL_PROCESS, the program will compute the
polynomial suface fit and substract it from the input images, only where image
values are valid (see NOVAL). 

.VARI FILL_SURFACE
This parameters has effect only when SURFACE_ONLY is activated. By default 
(NO_FILL), the computed best-fitted surface will keep missing values as such.
If FILL is set, then the computed best-fitting surface is computed for every
pixel. In that case.

.VARI OMP_ON
Turns on or off parallel processing.  The default is on. Note that this program
uses standard OpenMP (which is built in to the gcc/g++ compilers), so further 
details can be found in the OpenMP documentation.
