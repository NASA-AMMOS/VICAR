VICAR PROGRAM "geomz"
.HELP
 PURPOSE:

Program "geomz" is a VICAR applications program which is used to 
perform vertical (brightness or DN) correction of images by a set of
points specified as parameters or in a parameter data set.
"geomz" does not perform a geometric transformation (of line and sample 
coordinates) of the image.
.PAGE
 EXECUTION:

"geomz" is designed to be an analog of program "GEOMA".  Its application is
for vertical (brightness or DN) manipulations of images.  Vertical corrections
are specified by the user through tiepoints either as parameters or in a 
parameter file.  (Program "TIECONM" can produce a parameter file for "geomz".)
The "GEOMA" execution format has been imitated as closely as possible.

The size of the output image is determined by the number of lines and number 
of samples in the SIZE field if the SIZE field is entered by the user.  If the
SIZE field is not entered, the output file is the same size as the input file.

The data type of the input image may either be byte or halfword data.
The data type is obtained from the VICAR label of the input image.
The output image has the same data format  (byte or halfword) as the input 
image.  
.PAGE
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
      The following command line formats show the major allowable forms:
      geomz INP=a OUT=b SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) parameters
      geomz INP=a OUT=b  SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns parameters
      geomz a b (sl,ss,nl,ns) parameters
      geomz a b parameters
      geomz INP=a OUT=b SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns) PARMS=c optional parameters
      geomz INP=a OUT=b  SL=sl SS=ss NL=nl NS=ns PARMS=c optional parameters
      geomz a b (sl,ss,nl,ns) PARMS=c optional parameters
      geomz a b PARMS=c optional parameters

       Here 'a' represents the input image file name,
       'b' represents the output image file name,
       and 'c' represents the parameter file name.
.page
The tiepoint grid must be specified as as set of parameters either in the
TAE command line or in the parameter file.
The tiepoint grid is specified using the parameters NAH, NAV, and TIEPOINT.

   NAH=nah  NAV=nav TIEPOINT=( L1,S1,DZ1  L2,S2,DZ2 ... )

nah is the number of grid cells horizontally (across the top in the sample
direction), nav is the number of grid cells vertically. The grid must be
evenly-spaced and perfectly rectangular and the rows and columns must be
perfectly horizontal and vertical respectively. 
.PAGE
EXAMPLE

       geomz INP=A OUT=B SIZE=(1,1,500,1000)  NAH=1 NAV=1  FIXVAL=0   +
             TIEPOINT=(   1,1,10      1,1000, -10 +
                        500,1,10    500,1000, -10   )

This example cause the input to be changed by a ramp function with the
leftmost pixels becoming 10 DN brighter and the rightmost pixels becoming
10 DN dimmer.  Pixels with a 0 value in A are not changed because of the
FIXVAL parameter.
.PAGE
RESTRICTIONS
1. The input and output images must be byte or halfword data.
2. The maximum number of pixels per line is 60,000.
3. The maximum number of tiepoints is 40,000.  (If parameters are used 
   instead of a parameter file, the limit is 200.)
4. The maximum value for NAH is 200.
5. The maximum value for NAV is 3000
.page
 OPERATION:

The input picture is transformed pixel by pixel to the output picture by
adjusting the DN value according to nearby tiepoints.  A four (NAH) by 
three (NAV) tiepoint grid is illustrated below.  The tiepoints are marked 
with a '+' character.  The lines show how areas are defined by the grid.
A pixel within an area is adjusted according to the four tiepoints that
define the area containing that pixel.  Usually, this is a rectangle 
containing the pixel; but if the point lies outside the convex hull of the
grid, then the nearest rectangle is used for adjustment.

The DN adjustment is obtained by bilinear interpolation (or extrapolation)
of the adjustment at the four grid points.  The formula is

     DN (output) = DN (input) + ax + by + cxy + d

where x and y are the pixel coordinates and a,b,c,d are constants chosen
so that 

    delta DN(k) = ax(k) + by(k) + cx(k)y(k) + d          for k = 1,2,3,4,

where x(k) and y(k) are the coordinate values and delta DN(k) are the DN
shifts of the four selected tiepoints for the point x,y.

The calculation is performed by a double incrementing scheme.  For a single
line, the DN increment per pixel is given by  b+cx.  The starting values for
subsequent lines are incremented by  a+cy.  Thus the full solution is needed
only at the upper left corner of an area, and all other values are obtained
by incrementing.

After the delta-DN (DZ) values are added, the resulting DNs are then checked
for being valid for the data type (byte or halfword) of the image and are
adjusted if invalid.  For byte data, DNs less than 0 are set to 0, and DNs
greater than 255 are set to 255.  For halfword data, DNs less than 0 are set to
0, and DNs greater than 32767 are set to 32767.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input file name
.VARI OUT
Output file name
.VARI SIZE
Standard VICAR Size Field

.VARI NL
Number of lines for output

Number of samples for output
.VARI NAH
number of grid
cells horizontally

.VARI TIEPOINT
grid corner tiepoints in
rows L1,S1,DZ1,L2,...
.VARI FIXVAL
a single DN value (optional)
to be left unchanged by the
DN transformation.
.VARI PARMS
optional parameter file
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Input file name.  This parameter is input as:
     INP=innam
where "innam" is the input file name.
.VARI OUT
Output file name. This parameter is input as:
     OUT=outnam
where:
"outnam" is the output file name.
.VARI SIZE
The size field is specified with four arguments,
     SIZE=(a,b,c,d)
where:
a is the starting line number of the output picture.
b is the starting sample of the output picture.
c is the number of lines, and
d is the number of samples
For example, SIZE=(1,1,40,50)
would create an output picture of size 40 lines by 50 pixels.
The size field can be thought of as a window relative to the output
grid.  The first two values offset the window down and to the right
causing the features in the image to move up and to the left.
.VARI SL
SL can be used to specify the starting line of the output picture.
This is actually a coordinate relative to the output grid, therefore,
it offsets the output picture by (SL - 1.)  The default for SL is 1.
.VARI SS
SS can be used to specify the starting sample of the output picture.
This is actually a coordinate relative to the output grid, therefore,
it offsets the output picture by (SS - 1.)  The default for SS is 1.
.VARI NL
NL can be used in conjunction with NS in place of the SIZE
parameter to specify the size of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of lines for output.
.VARI NS
NS can be used in conjunction with NS in place of the SIZE
parameter to specify the size of the output picture.  It simply
represents the number of samples (pixels) for output.
.VARI NAH
the nah is number of grid cells horizontally, the number of tiepoints 
across is one larger (nah+1).  NAH must be an integer.  The default value is 1.
.VARI NAV
the nav is number of grid cells vertically, the number of tiepoints
vertically is one larger (nav+1).  NAV must be an integer.  The default value 
is 1.
.VARI TIEPOINT
The TIEPOINT keyword and associated numbers specify the mapping of control
points between output and input pictures.  The numbers which follow this
keyword are in groups of three, one group for each tiepoint.  The numbers
may be either integer or real.  The total number of tiepoint numbers must
be  3*(n+1)*(m+1), where n and m are given by the NAH and NAV parameters.
Within each group of three numbers describing a tiepoint, the first two
numbers give the line and sample coordinates of the tiepoint in the input
picture.  (The SIZE field, SS, SL have no effect on this location.)
The third value (DZ) specifies the amount of (vertical) shift in the DN
value at the tiepoint.  A positive value indicates an upward DN shift
(brighter), and a negative value indicates a downward DN shift (darker).
The order in which the tiepoints are specified is left to right within
a horizontal row of tiepoints.  The horizontal rows are ordered from top
to bottom.  A major difference between "geomz" and GEOMA formats is that
"geomz" tiepoints must be in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid.
.VARI FIXVAL
The default is to transform all DN values. FIXVAL=0 is commonly used to preserve
the outer background of an image so that mosaicking with THESH=0 can be used.
.VARI PARMS
A parameter data set containing the tiepoint parameters.  This file should
have been written by a program which uses the XVP routines for writing
parameter data sets, such as "TIECONM".
