VICAR PROGRAM VGRFILLIN
.help
PURPOSE:

VGRFILLIN will fill in all missing lines, partial lines, or truncated
lines for Voyager images stored as disk EDRs.  Disk EDRs are created by
the Voyager Real-Time Subsystem or via program VEDR.

.PAGE
EXECUTION:

	vgrfillin  IN  OUT
where
  IN is the input Voyager disk EDR.
  OUT is the output image.

The output image will be in standard VICAR format (with all binary header
information discarded).

.page
OPERATION:

  Data gaps are detected by examining data presence indicators in each
line header of the disk EDR.  The fill performed is an interpolation between
good lines.  If the gap is larger than 20 lines wide, or if it occurs at the
beginning or the end of the frame, it will not be filled.

In addition, VGRFILLIN will fill in lines truncated prior to transmission by
the data compressor on-board the spacecraft.  The compressor truncates pixels
on the right side of odd-numbered lines and on the left side of even-numbered
lines.  Truncated pixels are filled via interpolation using the nearest
available data above and below the line.  Sometimes the line truncation is
so severe as to leave a vertical gap down the middle of the image (called a
"gore"), where no data is available in either odd or even lines.  These
gores are filled via interpolation using the nearest available pixels to
the left and right of the gore.

Timing for VAX 780:
	4.7 cpu sec  filling 9 lines
	5.1          filling 40 lines
	5.8          filling 60 lines
	10           filling 800 lines truncated by about 200 samples

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
STRING - input VGR disk EDR
.VARI OUT
STRING - output image 
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
The input to VGRFILLIN must be a VGR disk EDR which is the output from the
Real-Time Subsystem.  The binary labels must be present.
Therefore, no program can be run on the data between IMBUILD and VGRFILLIN.
.VARI OUT
The output is a normal Vicar2 image (i.e. it no longer has binary labels,
but still has VGR labels.
