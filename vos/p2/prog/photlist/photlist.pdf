Vicar2 Program PHOTLIST
.HELP
PURPOSE:

PHOTLIST will compute the photometric parameters for specified areas of
an image.  PHOTLIST is restricted to Voyager images.

EXECUTION:

    PHOTLIST FDS=1636832 SCET=(1979,63,19,23,0,0) TARGET=IO +
       CRAFT=VGR-1 CAMERA=ISSN
where

    FDS is the 7-digit Flight Data System counter (FDS) specified as
       xxxxxyy where xxxxx is the Mod16 count and yy is the Mod60 count.
    SCET is the spacecraft event time specified as (year,day,hr,min,sec,msce).
    TARGET is the name of the target body.
    CRAFT is either VGR-1 or VGR-2.
    CAMERA is either ISSN or ISSW for the narrow and wide angle cameras.

OPERATION:

PHOTLIST will extract the geometry data for the image from SPICE kernels
and computes the following lighting parameters for the center
(C), upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL), and lower right (LR)
corners of the image, and at the target center (OSPC).  The line-sample 
coordinates at the target center is also reported for both geometrically
corrected (object space) and uncorrected (image space) images.  Object space
images have a 1000x1000 format and image space images have an 800x800 format.

 C-matrix source for frame xxxxxxx is FARENC

All longitudes are reported in System 3 west-longitude.  All latitudes are
planetocentric.

All calculations assume an oblate spheroid target model.  The equatorial and
polar radii are printed beside the target name.

The C matrix source is an indication of how accurately the camera pointing is
known.  If the source is SEDR, then the source of the camera pointing is from
predict data, and will in general be off by 50 or more pixels.  If the source
is NAV or FARENC, then the camera pointing has been determined by fitting the
limb, and is accurate to within 0.5 pixels or better.  If the source is NAV2,
NEAR, or AMOS, then the camera pointing has been determined via tiepoint
navigation (and is of indeterminate accuracy).  If the source is DAVI, then
the camera pointing has been determined by Mert Davies, and is considered to
be the most reliable source.

.page
POINT OFF TARGET:

The standard image space line-sample coordinates for the center and corners
(called reticle points) of the image are:

             UL=(1,1)                     UR=(1,800)

                          C=(400,400)

             LL=(800,1)                   LR=(800,800)

Occasionally, one or more of the reticle points calculated will be determined
to be off the target.  These points can be replaced by supplying different image
space line-sample coordinates as in the following example:

   photlist 2061657 LL=(500,100) LR=(500,800)

NOTE: By default, the supplied coordinates for C, UL, UR, LL, and LR are in 
      line-sample coordinates; however, such can be overridden by the 'LATLON 
      keyword.

.page
CORRECTING THE CAMERA POINTING:

The camera pointing can be corrected by specifying the object space line-sample
coordinates of the target-center via the OSPC parameter:

   photlist fds=2061657 scet=(1996,232,23,2,35,0) craft=vgr-1 +
     target=jupiter OSPC=(216,-14)

NOTE: the two examples will and should create different result.

For images containing a significant portion of the limb, these coordinates may
be derived via program NAV or measured directly off a print of the raw image.

.page
GEOMETRIC DISTORTIONS:

If the IBIS Reseau file is given (with the RES parameter) the program will read
the reseau locations from that file.  If the parameter is not given the nominal
locations of the reseau marks are used to model the geometric distortion in the
image.  


WARNING: The nominal reseau locations lead to an error of one or two pixels 
         near the center of the image.  The error grows progressively larger 
         toward the image margins and corners.

The distortion is removed by converting the line sample coordinates for each
reticle from the raw (image space) image to (distortion free) object space.

.page
A NOTE ON THE VOYAGER FDS:

The FDS is used as an index for accessing SEDR data.  The FDS associated with
the image is the FDS at the start of the camera cycle during which an image is
read out.  This is normally the same camera cycle in which the exposure takes
place.

A source of confusion occurs when simultaneous exposures are taken through the
narrow angle and wide angle cameras.  When this occurs, the image is read out
from the narrow angle camera immediately, while read-out of the wide angle
camera is suppressed until the following camera cycle.  The FDS associated
with the wide angle image will consequently not coincide with the camera cycle
during which the exposure took place, but will trail by one or more Mod60
counts, depending of the frame rate (FDS = FDS + frame-rate).

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE FDS
FDS is the 7-digit Flight Data System counter specified as
xxxxxyy where xxxxx is the Mod16 count and yy is the Mod60 count.  See help
file for details regarding simultaneous exposures.
.VARI OSPC
The camera pointing can be corrected by specifying the object space line-sample
coordinates of the target-center via the OSPC parameter.

For images containing a significant portion of the limb, these coordinates may
be derived via program NAV or measured directly off a print of the raw image.

Note that the effect of the OSPC parameter is completely different from that of
the C, UL, UR, etc. parameters.  The OSPC parameter is used to correct the
camera pointing whereas the latter merely change the location within the image
where calculations are performed.

.VARI C
Changes location in image where calculations for C (normally center of image)
are performed.
  e.g.  photlist 1234567 C=(300,300)
      where the coordinates are specified in image space
.VARI UL
Changes location in image where calculations for UL (normally upper left
corner of image) are performed.
  e.g.  photlist 1234567 UL=(300,300)
      where the coordinates are specified in image space
.VARI UR
Changes location in image where calculations for UR (normally upper right
corner of image) are performed.
  e.g.  photlist 1234567 UR=(300,300)
      where the coordinates are specified in image space
.VARI LL
Changes location in image where calculations for LL (normally lower left
corner of image) are performed.
  e.g.  photlist 1234567 LL=(300,300)
      where the coordinates are specified in image space
.VARI LR
Changes location in image where calculations for LR (normally lower right
corner of image) are performed.
  e.g.  photlist 1234567 LR=(300,300)
      where the coordinates are specified in image space
.VARI GRID
Defines additional points for PHOTLIST to report by specifying starting
point and incrementing values.  The specification is (SL,SS,LINC,SINC) where
  SL   = Starting Line
  SS   = Starting Sample
  LINC = Line increment
  SINC = Sample increment
The incrementing is done UNTIL either the LINE or SAMP exceeds the boundary
points 1..800 or 1..800 respectively.  (The UNTIL is empasized because initial
given point is not checked for the boundary)

  Ex:  GRID=(1,1,100,100)
         -------> reports (1,1),  (1,101),  (1,201)  ...(1,701)
                          (101,1),(101,101),(101,201)...(101,701)
                          (201,1),(201,101),(201,201)...(201,701)
                           .
                           .
                          (701,1),(701,101),(701,201)...(701,701)
                  in a left-right, then top to left order
                     if all are inside the target

       GRID=(701,701,-100,-100)
         -------> reports same as above but in reverse order (right-left,
                    botom-top) from the table presented above
                    if all are inside the target

       GRID=(-50,100,100,200)
         -------> reports (-50,100), (-50,300), (-50,500), (-50,700)
                          (50,100),  (50,300),  (50,500),  (50,700)
                           .
                           .
                          (750,100), (750,300), (750,500), (750,700)
                  if all are inside the target (left-right, top-botom)
                  NOTE: The initial point is reported even if it's outside the
                        boundary.  The boundary is not checked against -50 as
                        long as it is not incremented.

.VARIABLE VALUETYPE
 Specifies the coordinate system for user input of C, UL, UR, LL, LR
 (all except PC)
        LINESAMP - default, line/sample coordinate system of the geometrically
                            uncorrected image.
        LATLON   - latitude/longtitude coordinate system of the geometrically
                   corrected image.
.VARIABLE SEDRSRC
 Specifies source of desired camera pointing:
	DAVI	--Data determined by Mert Davies
	NAV     --Data determined by program NAV
	FARE    --Data determined by program FARENC
	NAV2    --Data determined by program NAV2
	NEAR    --Data determined by program NEARENC
        AMOS    --Data determined by program AMOS
	NAIF    --Data determined by NAIF
	SEDR    --Original SEDR values
 If this keyword is not specified, or if the specified source does not exist,
 the camera pointing will be selected from the available sources, in the
 following order of priority: (1) DAVI, (2) NAV, (3) FARE, (4) NAV2,
 (5) NEAR, (6) AMOS, (7) predict or final SEDR.
.VARIABLE PLANET
Planet of encounter.  The Voyager SEDR data is divided into separate files for
each planet.
.VARIABLE RES
Specifies the IBIS Format Reseau file to be read for obtaining the Reseau
locations of the image frame specifed by SCLK.  The Reseau file can be master
or one created by RESLOC as long as it has the Reseau locations for the image
frame specifed by the SCLK.

If this parameter is not given, the program uses the nominal values for the
Reseau locations which means that the output will not be as accurate.
