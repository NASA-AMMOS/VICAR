VICAR Program signal
.HELP
PURPOSE:
   Signal is a VICAR applications program which outputs the signal of a specific
pixel from a set of flat-field image.  The exposure and signal is output into
an ASCII text file.  If the input images are PICSUM'd, then the value of the
pixel specified by LS is divided by the PISCALE value that is in the VICAR
label.  If there is no PICSCALE value, then the input is assumed not to be
PICSUM'd.

This program was written for the Cassini ISS camera and expects that the
flat-field images have a valid Cassini label.

EXECUTION STATEMENT:

  SIGNAL INP=(D1,D2,D3,...,Dn) TBL=SIGNAL.TBL LS=(100,201)

     or

  SIGNAL LIST=FILENAME.LIST TBL=SIGNAL.TBL LS=(100,201)

The flat-field filenames may be input to the program in the form of a
SRCH-format text file (see program NXT).  The output TBL produces a
tab-delimited ASCII text file containing EXPOSURE and SIGNAL.

RESTRICTIONS:

1.  A maximum of 50 exposure levels are allowed.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
 STRING-OPTIONAL
 Flat-field & DC images.
.VARIABLE TBL
 STRING--REQUIRED
 ASCII text output file
.VARIABLE LIST
 STRING--OPTIONAL
 SRCH-format file containing
 the names of the files
 to be processed.
.VARIABLE LS
 STRING--REQUIRED
Line and sample for which
you want the signal
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 STRING--OPTIONAL
	INP=(D1,D2,D3,...,Dn)
 Inputs are flat-field images which may have been PICSUM'd.
.VARIABLE TBL
 STRING--REQUIRED
 The output ASCII text file which contains the exposure and signal of the
 specified pixel.
.VARIABLE LIST
 STRING--OPTIONAL
 Specifies the name of the SRCH-format text file containing the names of
 the input files to be processed.  This is an alternative to listing the 
 filenames with the INP parameter.  
.VARIABLE LS
 STRING--REQUIRED
 The line and sample of the pixel whose exposure and signal is output.
