PURPOSE

     TIEPLOT plots tiepoints in an IBIS interface file by
     drawing vectors to indicate the direction and amount of
     shift between the old (line,sample)  new (line,sample)
     pairs.  The image area is outlined and labeled.  A number
     or symbol from the interface file may be plotted at each 
     tiepoint position.

     
TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     TIEPLOT INP=A PARAMS
     A                   is an IBIS interface file.     
     PARAMS              is a standard VICAR parameter field.
.PAGE
OPERATION

     For each tiepoint that has the correct entry in the
     KEYCOL, a vector is drawn with a length proportional
     to the distance between the old (line,sample) coordinates
     and the new (line,sample) coordinates.

.PAGE
PARAMETERS
    INP  an input ibis tabular file containing the tiepoints from
two images
    NL and NS  the number of lines and samples of the image to
show the tiepoints plot   
    PLOTOUT   the name of the output plot. It will yield two
files named PLOTOUT.gpi  and PLOTOUT.asc
    PLOTFMT   The type of plot, either GNUPLOT or EPS
    NEWCOLS  are the column numbers in INP containing the tiepoints
in the new image.
    OLDCOLS are the column numbers in INP containing the tiepoints
in the old image.
    NUMCOL  (optional) is a column containing a number to be plotted
along side the tiepoint symbol.
    CHARCOL (optional)  is a column containing a number of a symbol
to be used to plot to indicate the location of a tiepoint.
    ICHAR  (optional) is a symbol number
    SCALE   is the magnification number for showing tiepoint offsets
    KEY     is which key in the key column to plot.  Each key
specifies a separate plot
    KEYCOL  is the column number to look for the key value


.PAGE
PLOT OUTPUTS

    The other type of output come from the PLOTOUT and PLOTFMT parameters.
PLOTOUT produces a file of gnuplot commands contained in a file having a .gpi
file extension. Another file with an .asc extension is created containing
columms of data that are displayed by the gpi file.

   The PLOTFMT parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing PLOTFMT=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.

.PAGE

  PLOT NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the PLOTOUT parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  PLOTOUT=outplot
  then for the interactive plot the following files are produced:

     outplot.gpi
     outplot.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot.      

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with PLOTFMT=eps
  then the following files are produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     outplot.asc


  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps

  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the plot command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  plot  'output.asc' u  1: 9 t .......


.PAGE
USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which are written out as a separate file. The plot is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the plot by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the plot by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the plot. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the plot to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the plot is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains columns of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions are discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the plot alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.

  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi
  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the plot).

  Note: This program creates 5 output plots per run. You bring up each plot
  panel sequentially. You close each plot by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the plot.


  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  plot suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy plot via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps

.PAGE
    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT plot library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages are used.

EXAMPLES

Tieplot tiepoints.int nl=1056 ns=1204  scale=10

In this example, just one plot will be produced since the KEYCOL parameter
has not been specified.  The default columns for the tiepoints (columns 
1, 2, 3, and 4,  same as output by PICMATCH) will be assumed.  The length
of the offset vectors will be magnified by a factor of 10, and no
symbols or numbers will label the vectors. The plot output will be 
named tieplot.


ibis-gen out=table1.dat nc=7 nr=30
mf3 inp=table1.dat func=("c1=@aint(@index/31)+1"$"c2=100*@index"$ +
    "c3=100*@index"$"c4=c2+101"$"c5=c3-200"$"c6=@aint(@index)"$"c7=0")

tieplot inp=i.dat nl=3000 ns=3000 keycol=1 key=(1,2)+
  scale=20 newcols=(4,5) oldcols=(2,3) numcol=6  +
  plotout=tieplot2

In this example an IBIS file of 7 columns and 30 rows is created,
it is divided into 2 subsets of 15 rows each (control column C1
has 1 in the first 15 rows and 2 in the next 15 rows). Old coordinates
are in columns 2 and 3, new coordinates are in columns 4 and 5.
Number of each point is contained in column 6. Two plots, each con-
taining vectors for 15 points will be generated.
