comptab - tabulate connected components to an IBIS file
.HELP
PURPOSE:
comptab creates an IBIS tabular file from a connected component image and
from 0 to 48 registered brightness or difference images.  The connected
component image is a halfword image, usually created by program CONCOMP.
The registered images can be byte or half.  The IBIS tabular file that is 
output has one record for each connected component and the following
columns:

1.  The component number
2.  The count of pixels in the component, can be converted to area
3.  The line number of the first pixel scanned (in l,s order) of the component
4.  The sample number of the first pixel scanned
5.  The diameter in pixels of the component
6.  The average brightness or pixel value of the component in the 1st input image
7.  The average brightness or pixel value of the neighborhood of the component
    in the 1st input image
8.  The average brightness or pixel value of the component in the 2d input image
9.  The average brightness or pixel value of the neighborhood of the component
    in the 2d input image
etc

the last 10 columns are set to 0.0 to allow room for user calculation.

If a SIZE parameter is used, it applies to all of the input images.

EXECUTION:

Example

comptab INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D  A is the connected component image.  B and C are
                          registered brightness images. D is the output tabular file

OPERATION:

The statistics are read into an array from the input images.  The output
statistics are calculated and then written to an IBIS file.
 TIMING: 

all algorithms are linear with the image area.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input image files; 1st
is connected component; others
registered brightness or dif-
ference images
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output IBIS tabulr file
.VARIABLE SIZE
INTEGER - Region of input files
to be concatenated
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of samples
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the input data sets.  Up to 48 are allowed.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The SIZE parameter may be used when only a sub-region of each image is to
be concatenated; it has the format SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS), where the parameters
are starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.  SIZE=(1,1,10,10), for example, will cause comptab to only look
at the first ten samples of each of the first ten lines in each image, when
performing the concatenation. The default (1,1,0,0) means use the whole image.
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of samples (see SIZE)
