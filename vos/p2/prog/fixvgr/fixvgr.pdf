.TITLE
"fixvgr" -- Voyager radiometric scale correction program.
.HELP
PURPOSE:

"fixvgr" corrects the DN scale of Voyager images by multiplying each pixel
by a constant.  The resulting image is radiometrically more accurate.

	fixvgr INP=A OUT=B
where
	A = an image that has been radiometrically corrected by "ficor77".
	B = scaled output image.

Both input and output images are in 16-bit integer (halfword) data format.
The input may be any size (e.g. 800x800 geometrically uncorrected,
1000x1000 geometrically corrected, map projected) as long as it is in
the same radiometric scale as the "ficor77" output.

NOTE: As of March 1988, the scale correction was implemented directly into
"ficor77".  "fixvgr" need not be applied to images processed by "ficor77"
after this date (unless they need to be rescaled).

OPERATION:

The applied scaling corrects for errors in ground calibration of the camera
system's response through each of the filters, and adjusts for target distance
from the sun using the inverse square law.
		
The scale correction factor is a function of camera, filter, and planet-of-
encounter (target distance from the sun).  The camera serial number and
filter position are extracted automatically from the input picture label.
These values may be overridden via the CAMERA and FILTER parameters.

For Voyager 2, the planet-of-encounter is determined by searching the frame
label for a valid PICNO, Spacecraft-Event-Time (SCET), or Earth-Received-
Time (ERT), in that order.  This may be overridden via the PLANET keyword.

For Voyager 1, the planet-of-encounter is always set to Jupiter, and this
may not be overridden.

The scale factor is retrieved from a table stored in the Scale Correction
File (SCF).  This file may be specified by the SCF parameter.

The following scale correction is applied to each pixel:

	ODN = S*A1*IDN
where
	IDN is the DN value of the input pixel
	ODN is the DN value of the output pixel
	S is the scale factor retrieved from the SCF
	A1 is the number of 'I over F' units per DN, as reported in the
	    picture label by "ficor77".

Images scale-corrected by "fixvgr" may be identified by the following picture
label:

  (e.g) COMMENT=' PICTURE MULTIPLIED BY  0.93   FIXVGR	2/02/86 VERSION'
	SCALE='URANUS'

where 0.93 is the product S*A1, URANUS is the planet-of-encounter, and
2/02/86 is the version date of the SCF.

The resulting output image has a scale of 1 I/F unit per DN, where
10,000 I/F units would be produced by normal incidence of sunlight on a
Lambert disk at the target-body's distance from the sun (5.2 AU for
Jupiter, 9.51 AU for Saturn, 19.122 AU for Uranus, and xx.x AU for Neptune).

After March 1988, the scale correction was implemented directly into
"ficor77".  "fixvgr" need not be run on images processed by "ficor77" 
after this date.  However, if rescaling is desired (because of any future
update to the table), "fixvgr" may be used to perform this.

.page
RESCALING:

The table of scale factors was first installed on 1/16/81 using the values
from Reference 1.  The values for the violet, orange, and UV filters for
the VGR-2 narrow-angle camera (filter positions 1,3, and 7) were updated
2/2/86 using the values from Reference 2.  Provision exits for future
updates to the table.

Images which have been scale corrected by "ficor77" or "fixvgr" using an older
version of the table may be rescaled by running "fixvgr".  "fixvgr" may also be
used to rescale an image to a new target-body.  The rescaling consists of:

	       S
	ODN = ---*IDN
	       So

where So and S are the old and new scale factors retrieved from the SCF.

.page
EXAMPLE:

"fixvgr" is normally executed as follows:

	fixvgr E1 E2  scf=/project/test_work/testdata/mipl/vgr/vgrscf.dat

where E1 is the input image and E2 is the output image.  The following
example illustrates how each of the parameters are entered:

   fixvgr E1 E2 (301,301,200,200) 'SATURN CAMERA=4 FILTER=7 'NONEG

The output will be a 200 x 200 image, representing the sub-area of the
input image beginning at pixel coordinates (301,301).

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
STRING--REQUIRED
Specifies the input image.  The image must have been radiometrically
corrected by "ficor77" and be in 16-bit integer (halfword) data format.
It may be any size (e.g. 800x800 geometrically uncorrected,
1000x1000 geometrically corrected, map projected) as long as it is in
the same radiometric scale as the "ficor77" output.
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING--REQUIRED
Specifies the output image.
.VARIABLE SIZE
4 INTEGERS--OPTIONAL
	SIZE=(sl,ss,nl,ns)
Specifies the input image area to be processed by starting line, starting
sample, number of lines, and number of samples.  The output image will
be nl x ns samples in area.
If defaulted, the entire image is processed.
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER--OPTIONAL
The Starting Line in the input picture to be used for the output 
picture.  The default is SL=1.
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER--OPTIONAL
The Starting Sample in the input picture to be used for the output
picture.  The default is SS=1.
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER--OPTIONAL
The Number of Lines in the input picture to be processed to the
output picture.  If defaulted, all image lines are processed.
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER--OPTIONAL
The Number of Samples in the input picture to be processed to the
output picture.  If defaulted, NS is the entire width of the input image.
.VARI PLANET
KEYWORD--OPTIONAL
Specifies the planet-of-encounter.  Valid values are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
or Neptune.

For Voyager 1, the planet-of-encounter is always set to Jupiter, and this
keyword is ignored (only Jupiter scale factors are available for VGR-1).

If defaulted for Voyager 2, the planet-of-encounter is determined by
searching the frame label for a valid PICNO, Spacecraft-Event-Time (SCET)
or Earth-Received-Time (ERT), in that order.  If the fifth character of the
PICNO is a 'J','S','U', or 'N', this is accepted as a valid planet ID.
Otherwise, if the SCET or ERT year is greater than 74, the planet is determined
as follows:

	ERT YEAR	PLANET	   VGR-1 Encounter   VGR-2 Encounter
	--------	------	   ---------------   ---------------
	less than 80	Jupiter	     Mar  5 79		Jul  9 79
	80 to 84	Saturn	     Nov 12 80		Aug 25 81
	85 to 87	Uranus				Jan 24 86
	88 and beyond	Neptune				Aug 24 89
.VARIABLE CAMERA
INTEGER--OPTIONAL
  Ex: CAMERA=4
Specifies the camera ID (serial number) of the input image (PIC).  This
overrides the camera ID extracted from the image's picture label.  The
camera serial numbers of the Voyager spacecraft are:
	4 = VGR-2 WA		6 = VGR-1 WA
	5 = VGR-2 NA		7 = VGR-1 NA
.VARIABLE FILTER
INTEGER--OPTIONAL
	Ex: FILTER=4
Specifies the camera filter position for the input image.  The filters are
mounted on an 8-position filter wheel as follows:

	#  Narrow-Angle   Wide-Angle
	-  ------------   ----------
	0  Clear	  Methane (J-S-T)
	1  Violet	  Blue	  
	2  Blue		  Clear
	3  Orange	  Violet
	4  Clear	  Na-D
	5  Green	  Green
	6  Green	  Methane (U)
	7  Ultraviolet	  Orange

This parameter overrides the filter position extracted from the label of
the input image.
.VARIABLE NONEG
KEYWORD--OPTIONAL
Valid: 'NONEG
Specifies that all negative DNs will be set to zero.  The default is to output
rescaled negative numbers.  NONEG is a relic of the IBM days when "geoma" 
would die by ingesting negative DN values.
.VARIABLE NOCORREC
KEYWORD--OPTIONAL
Valid: 'NOCORREC
Specifies that no scale correction is to be done.  If both 'NOCORRECT and
'NONEG are specified, the output image is the same as the input image except
that all negative DNs have been set to zero.  If 'NOCORRECT is specified but
'NONEG is not specified, the output image is an exact copy of the input
image.  In practice, the NONEG and NOCORRECT keywords are no longer used.
.VARIABLE SCF
STRING--OPTIONAL
	Ex:  SCF="/project/test_work/testdata/mipl/vgr/vgrscf.dat"
Specifies the Scale Correction File, as generated by program "ficorgen".
Note that since this file is rarely updated, the default usually points to
the most recent file and this parameter is normally not specified.

Note: The default location for the SCF points to a location at the MIPS
facility.  When running FIXVGR at another facility, please copy the SCF and
point to the new location.
