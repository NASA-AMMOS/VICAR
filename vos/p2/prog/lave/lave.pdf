LAVE
.HELP
PURPOSE:
LAVE calculates the average DN values or the standard deviation values for each
line (HORIZONTAL mode) or each column (VERTICAL mode) of samples within a
picture.  The output is either a single line of the average (or standard
deviation)  DN values (default) or an image the same size as the input picture,
but with each pixel replaced by its average (or standard deviation) value
(IMAGE mode).  LAVE determines the data format from the VICAR label of the
image.  LAVE works on byte, halfword, fullword, and real*4 data.

EXECUTION:

LAVE A OUT=C FILTER=7		Find the averages of rows (default), perform 
				a box filter with window size 7, and send the 
				output to image file C.
LAVE A MODE=VERT 		Find column averages.  Print the results only.
LAVE A OUT=C MODE=IMAGE		Find averages of rows, and write image same
				size as original image (with each pixel
				replaced by its average value) out to C.
LAVE A EXCLUDE=1		Ignore all samples with value of 1.
LAVE A FILTER=3 'HIGH	        Do filter with window size 3, and highpass
				output.

LAVE A OUT=C SIZE=(50,20,100,200) 'IMAGE 'VERT

has the same effect as	LAVE A B SIZE=(50,20,100,200) MODE=VERT 
			SIZE B C SIZE=(1,1,100,200)

LAVE A C FILTER=7 

has the same effect as	LAVE A B
			BOXFLT2 B C NLW=1 NSW=7

OPERATION:
The input picture is read and the average DN values are computed, excluding
any pixels of the DN specified by the EXCLUDE keyword.  If there remain no
pixels to be averaged, the output pixel is assigned 0 DN.  All the average
values are then printed.  If a filter has been requested, the average values
are filtered and those values are also printed.  Unless the keyword IMAGE
was specified, a single line of average values is output.  Note that in the
HORIZONTAL mode, the number of samples output is the number of LINES input.
If the keyword IMAGE was used, a full-size image is produced by either
repeating the line of average values, once for each line (VERTICAL mode), or
repeating each average value once for each sample, with each average value
on its original line (HORIZONTAL mode).

If STDEV is specified, standard deviation values are used instead of averages.

  1994-08-31 ??? - Ported to Unix
  2010-12-10 R. J. Bambery - Fixes for 64-bit linux,macosx
  2013-09-02 R. J. Bambery - Blank out 132 character buffer before filling
             to prevent garbage at end of xvmessage statements. 
  2016-07-14 R. J. Bambery - Removed 2 GB maximum image size.
             by changing stacka call with stacka_big call
             Centos-7.2 & gcc-4.8.5
  2016-12-18 W. L. Bunch - replaced stacka_big with stacka; added
             quiet keyword to silence screen output; migrated to MIPL.

any.

the output instead of averages.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE OUT
OUT specifies the name of the output file.  If the output file specification
is omitted, output is sent only to the screen.
.VARIABLE MODE
MODE specifies one of the following options:

HORIZONT indicates that averaging will be done along each line (default).
VERTICAL indicates that averaging will be done along each column.
.VARIABLE HIGHPASS
HIGH causes the high-pass version of the filter to be output.  Pixel
	values created by the high-pass specification are determined
	by taking the average value of the pixels within the 
	user-specified window dimension and then subtracting the value
	of the pixel prior to filtering, and, for byte data only, adding 128 
        to the result.
.VARIABLE IMAGE
IMAG causes the creation of a full-size image where each pixel is replaced
	in value by the average for its particular row (HORIZONTAL mode)
	or column (VERTICAL mode).
.VARIABLE STDEV
The default is to compute averages.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
EXCLUDE selects a particular pixel value to be ignored by the program.
(Default is to include all samples.)
.VARIABLE FILTER
FILTER specifies the filtering option and the width of the window to
be used.  An m-element box filter will be performed on the line of
average DN values before the line is output.  (Default is no filtering
on the line.)
.VARIABLE AIS
By default, the print-out is not in AIS format.  The AIS keyword
does not affect the size of the output file.
.VARIABLE TITLE
This parameter is used with the AIS parameter. The maximum title length
is 122 characters.
.VARIABLE QUIET
KEYWORD - If specified, the screen output will be disabled.
