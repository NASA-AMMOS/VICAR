.TITLE
VICAR program MAPAUX

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To map project irregularly shaped objects (ISO's) such as asteroids, 
comet nuclei, and planetesimals.
Support programs include: TRICOEF SNYDER or
                          EFGISO AUXILIARY or
                          AREAISO

EXECUTION:
mapaux inp=(target,lat,lon,tissot) out=(projection,proj_of_tissot)

where:

target is the desired output image label created by map3.
lat is the auxiliary to centric latitude mapping created by program auxiliary.
lon is the auxiliary to centric longitude mapping created by program auxiliary.
tissot is the mapping residual tissot angle.

projection is the generated projection with the identical label to target.map
proj_of_tissot is the tissot angle in degrees projected the same as projection
but is a REAL image.

If the first input has no map3 label then the Cheng equal area projection
will be made with mode of north or south. This image covers the north or
south hemispheres and uses the size of the input file.
You must specify either north or south keywords in this case.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
Input projection label.
latitude mapping.
longitude mapping.
tissot angle.

.VARI OUT
Output projection.
Output tissot angle.

.VARI PLANET
Planet name

.VARI PATH
Directory path for
planet models

.VARI GRID
Lat & lon grid
interval.

.VARI MODE
mode=north or
mode=south
no input projection.
Cheng equal area.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Four inputs:
1. The desired output image label created by map3.
2. The auxiliary to centric latitude mapping created by program auxiliary.
3. The auxiliary to centric longitude mapping created by program auxiliary.
4. The mapping residual tissot angle.

.VARI OUT
Two outputs:
1. Output projection with the identical label to the input.
2. The same projection but of the tissot angle.

.VARI PLANET
The planet or object name.

.VARI PATH
The directory name where the planet models reside.

.VARI GRID
Lat & lon grid interval to draw on the planetocentric data before projection..

.VARI MODE
If the input has no map3 label you must specify either 'north or 'south
to specify the hemisphere to be projected using Chen's polar equal area
projection.
