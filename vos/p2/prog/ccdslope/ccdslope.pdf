PURPOSE:
 
CCDSLOPE measures the light transfer properties of a CCD camera system.
The camera's response to light is assumed to be linear, and the slope
and offset of the light transfer curve are determined by the program.
 
The program is one of a series of programs originally developed to support
radiometric calibration of the Galileo SSI camera system.

EXECUTION:

The input is a Light Transfer File (LTF) containing statistical data for
specified areas in the image for each exposure of a light transfer
sequence.  The LTF must have been previously initialized via LTGEN and
loaded with data via MOMGEN.
 
The output is an optional MARK-format tiepoint data set containing the
centers of all rejected areas.
 
.PAGE
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND:
 
For a linear camera system, the light transfer curve has the following
form:
                d = m*e + b
 
where
        d = output signal (DN)
        e = incident light energy (foot-lambert-milliseconds (UNITS=LUMINANC) or
                    picoamp-milliseconds (UNITS=RADIANCE))
 
and m and b are the slope and offset terms to be determined.
The incident light energy is computed from
 
                e = L*t
 
where
        L = light canon setting (foot-lamberts (UNITS=LUMINANC) or
                                 picoamp (UNITS=RADIANCE))
        t = exposure time (milliseconds)
 
CCDSLOPE performs a least squares fit to solve for m and b, given data
points d  acquired at exposure times t .
        i                             i
 
.PAGE
OPERATION:

CCDSLOPE performs the following steps:
 
  1) Read data from the Light Transfer File.
  2) Compute slope and offset for each area.
  3) Compute mean value for slope and offset and flag all areas
     deviating by more than 2 sigma from the mean.
  4) Re-compute the mean value for slope and offset, ignoring all
     flagged values as specified by the REJECT parameter.
 
The light transfer curve slope and offset for a given area is determined
by computing the mean DN and energy at each exposure time, and fitting
the resulting data points (d ,t ) via least squares.
                            i  i
 
The dark current frame (EXPO=0.0) is normally included as a data point
on the curve.  For GLL light transfer sequences which contain extended
exposure mode frames, an adjustment is required to correct for differences
between the normal and extended exposure dark current.  This correction
consists of subtracting the extended exposure dark current and adding
the normal dark current to the mean DN's of all extended exposure frames.
 
If the keyword SUBDC is specified, the dark current is subtracted from the
mean DN at each exposure.  If extended exposure frames exist, then the
extended exposure dark current is subtracted the the mean DN's at these
exposures.
 
If extended exposure mode frames exist (possible for Galileo data), the
EXTEXPO parameter must normally be specified to indicate the exposure
level at which the extended exposures begin.
 
   Example:  EXTEXPO=7 specifies that the 7th exposure level (above the
             dark current) begins the extended exposures.
 
However, light-transfer sequences consisting entirely of extend-exposure
frames should be input as if they were normal exposures, i.e. the extended-
exposure dark-current should be inserted in place of the normal dark-current
and the EXTEXPO parameter should not be used.
 
The OFFSETS parameter is used to specify a shutter-offset file (as generated
by program CCDRECIP) containing the shutter-offset for each line or sample
of the image (800 values for GLL or 1024 for Cassini).  These shutter-offsets
are used to correct for differences between the actual and commanded
exposures.  If the OFFSETS parameter is not specified, then a mean shutter
offset is used (see MOFSET parameter).
 
Note:  The shutter-offset file supplied must contain one and only one
entry for each line or sample of the image data.  The 800 entries in
Galileo's line-dependent shutter-offset file correspond to the 800 lines
of a Galileo image.  The 1024 entries in the Cassini sample-dependent
shutter-offset file correspond to the 1024 samples of a Cassini image.
 
The MOFSET parameter may be used to specify a mean shutter-offset.  If
line- or sample-dependent shutter-offsets are input via the OFFSETS
parameter, then the mean shutter-offset is computed by averaging these
offsets (overriding the MOFSET parameter).
 
If the REJECT parameter is specified (default=1), areas may be rejected
because of a bad value for the slope (REJECT=1), offset (REJECT=2),
or either (REJECT=3).  If REJECT=0, no area rejection is performed.
 
If the keyword DELTAX is specified, the above steps are repeated
after adjusting the energy levels so that the resulting curve
passes through the origin.  This is accomplished by adding the
ratio OFFSET/SLOPE to each energy term.
 
CCDSLOPE prints out the following:
 
  1) Slope and offset for each area specified.
  2) Summary of all areas flagged for bad slope or offset.
  3) A table listing mean DN vs input light energy for 6 regions.
  4) A global value for the slope and offset, computed by combining
     the data for all the good areas (and performing a fit.
 
If an output file is specified, then the centers of all flagged values
as specified by the REJECT parameter are stored in a MARK format data
set.
 
If a PLOT file is specified, a plot of mean DN vs input light energy
is output to the file.  The plot is generated for the four corners and
center of the frame, and for the entire frame.
 
The illumination value specified by the LIGHT parameter is used to convert the
exposure times (msec) into incident energy (Foot-Lambert-msec (UNITS=LUMINANC)
or picoamp (UNITS=RADIANCE)).  The illumination value of for this Light 
Transfer File may be defaulted such that it is read from the label of the 
file (for Cassini).  Parameter input will always override the value in the 
label.
 
If an output file is specified for the TABLE parameter, an ASCII file of
tab-delimitted text is output.  This file will contain a tabular list of the
data contained in the plots.  For each of 6 areas (Upper left, Upper right,
Lower left, Lower right, Center and Whole frame), the following values are
tabulated for all exposure levels present in the LT file:
 
 Mean DN, DN computed from derived Slope and Offset, Energy

PLOT OUTPUTS

    The other type of output come from the PLOT and PLOTFMT parameters.
PLOT allows the user to display data from 5 areas on the CCD on an x,y
plot using the gnuplot package after exiting the program. PLOT produces
a file of gnuplot commands contained in a file having a .gpi file extension.
Another file with an .asc extension is create containing columns of data
that are displayed by the gpi file.

   The PLOTFMT parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing PLOTFMT=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.
.PAGE

  PLOT NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the PLOT parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  PLOT=outplot
  then for the interactive plot the following files are produced:

     outplot.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot.      

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with PLOTFMT=eps
  then the following files are produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps

  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the plot command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  plot  'indata.dat.asc' u  1: 9 t .......

USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which are written out as a separate file. The plot is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the plot by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the plot by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the plot. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the plot to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the plot is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains columns of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions are discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the plot alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.

  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi

  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the plot).

  Note: This program creates 5 output plots per run. You bring up each plot
  panel sequentially. You close each plot by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the plot.


  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  plot suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy plot via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps

    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT plot library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages are used.
