PURPOSE

Determine point spread function from image

OPERATION

This program copies a point spread function (PSF) contained in the
input image to an output image in a format suitable for the production
of the optical transfer function (OTF) by program "fft22".  The
program was designed to be used in the procedure "restore", which deconvolves
the point spread function from an image, but can also be used in stand-
alone mode.

The input image is normally a star or the output of an appropriate test target
from a camera test.

The AREA parameter restricts where in the image the psf object occurs. For
example, if the PSF is from a starfield there may be other stars in the field
you wish to ignore. Similarly the output from a camera calibration test target
may have a border or other types of targets in the field.

EXECUTION FORMAT:

  psf  IN  OUT  SIZE  AREA  SHIFT

where:	IN	is the input image.
	OUT	is the output point spread function.
	SIZE	is the size of the output file, and should be
		  the same dimension as the image to which the
		  OTF will be applied.
	AREA	is a required parameter defining the location of
		  the point spread function in the input image.
	SHIFT   is an optional parameter determining whether the
		  PSF area will be allowed to shift in the input. SHIFT
          is like what FFTFLIP does for FFTs.

METHOD

First, the program determines the mean of the DNs lying on the border
of the region defined by the AREA parameter.  This mean is used as the
background DN value.  The subimage of size determined by AREA minus the
background value is the PSF.

Next, the program determines the centroid of the PSF.  The subimage is
quartered about the pixel closest to the centroid and is copied into
the four corners of the output data set.  (This process is intended to
eliminate translation of an image when deconvolved with the point spread
function, although subpixel translations will still be present.)  The
rest of the output file is left empty (0 DN).  

The program works with BYTE, HALF, FULL and REAL formats. Its output
format is the same as the input.  

It warns you if negative numbers are found in the image. If so, it
returns a value of 1 in the NEGATIVE return parameter.

RESTRICTIONS

    For REAL images negative values are converted to 0. So centroid is
only computed from positive values. If it is important, you may convert 
images with negative values to all positive by MAXMIN and F2 before
processing with PSF.

                Program now accepts BYTE, HALF, FULL and REAL images
                Added NEGATIVE return parameter.

.LEVEL1
.vari INP
Input image
.vari OUT
Output PSF
.vari SIZE
Size of output file.
 = (SL,SS,NL,NS)
.vari SL
Starting line
(always 1)
.VARI SS
Starting sample
(always 1)
.VARIABLE NL
Number of Lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.vari AREA
Area containing PSF.
.VARI SHIFT
Shift PSF about new
centroid?
.VARI NEGATIVE
A return parameter. If 1 then
negative numbers were found in
image.
.LEVEL2
.vari INP
INP is the name of the image file from which the PSF will be extracted,
using the AREA parameter.
.vari OUT
OUT is the name of the output file into which the properly formatted PSF
will be written.
.vari SIZE
SIZE is the standard Vicar2 parameter containing:
 
  (Starting Line, Starting Sample, Number of Lines, Number of Samples)
 
Note that in this program it refers only to the output file, and therefore
the first two elements are ignored.  This parameter is included only for
unformity in Vicar2 application program interface.
.vari SL
See HELP SIZE.
.vari SS
See HELP SIZE.
.VARIABLE NL
NL specifies the size of the image in the line direction, i.e., the
number of lines in the image.
.VARIABLE NS
NS specifies the size of the image in the sample direction, i.e.,
the number of pixels per line in the image.
.vari AREA
AREA specifies the area in the input file (INP) from which the PSF will be
extracted, after subtraction of the background DN value.  It has the
same structure as the SIZE parameter, i.e.:
 
  (Starting Line, Starting Sample, Number of Lines, Number of Samples).
 
Note that the last two elements should be less than or equal to the
corresponding elements in SIZE (or NL and NS) for meaningful results.

If NOSHIFT is specified, then the final PSF will remain strictly inside
this area after determination of the centroid.  Otherwise, the final
PSF will be of the same size as specified by AREA, but centered on the
centroid of the function.
.vari SHIFT
This parameter controls whether the PSF will be allowed to shift outside
the area specified by the AREA parameter after determination of its
centroid.

If SHIFT is specified, then the final PSF will be of the size specified 
by the AREA parameter, but centered on the centroid of the function. (If
part falls outside the image, the size is reduced accordingly.)  This is
the normal choice when the user does know the exact location of the PSF
in the input.

If NOSHIFT is specified, then the area of the PSF remains that specified
by AREA, but the quartering is done about the centroid, so that the four
quarters may be unequal.  This choice is useful if the location of the
PSF in the input is accurately known and it is important that data
outside this area be excluded.
