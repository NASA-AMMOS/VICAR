.TITLE
VICAR program MPFTPT1

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To compute, from a stereo pair, the line and sample disparity
of every pixel in the scene.
This program only computes horizontal disparity by 1-d correlations using
many lines taken together.

EXECUTION:
mpftpt1 inp=(left,right) out=(line_disparity,sample_disparity,quality) parameters
where:
left is the left eye image of a stereo pair
right is the corresponding right eye image of a stereo pair
line_disparity is the right eye line value.
sample_disparity is the right eye sample value.
quality is the correlation quality.

.PAGE

METHOD:
MPFTPT1 performs a fast 1-d correlation between the left and the right
eye images using NLW lines at a time.
Note: correlations are only computed on integral pixel boundaries.

Output file contents:
 
All output files are in the coordinates of the first (left eye) image.
For example if output file #2 has a value of 56.67 at sample 50 it means
that the sample location of a tiepoint located at sample 50 in the left
eye image corresponds to sample 56.67 in the right eye image.
 
First output: A REAL image containing the line disparity. This is the line in
the second input (right eye) which corresponds to the line in the first
input image (left eye). This program generates a line disparity which is
always zero (unless the SHIFT keyword is used).
If both left & right disparity values are 0.000 the point has no value.
 
Second output: A REAL image containing the sample disparity. This is the sample
in the second input (right eye) which corresponds to the sample in the first
input image (left eye).
If both left & right disparity values are 0.000 the point has no value.

.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
First left eye image, then right eye image.
 
.VARI OUT
First output: A REAL image containing the line disparity. This is the line in
the second input (right eye) which corresponds to the line in the first
input image (left eye).
Second output: A REAL image containing the sample disparity. This is the sample
in the second input (right eye) which corresponds to the sample in the first
input image (left eye).
Third output: A REAL image containing the normalized quality, 0 to 1.

.VARI NLW
Correlation size height. An odd number.
The number of lines correlated at one time.
Defaults to 9.

.VARI TEMPLATE
Correlation size. Odd number. Defaults to 23.
 
.VARI SEARCH
Correlation search area. Odd number. Defaults to 95.
SEARCH > TEMPLATE.

.VARI SHIFT
Line displacement of right image before correlation.
- is down, + is up. 
A shift were +1, means that the right image is shifted up one line to match
the left image before correlation begins.
Default shift is zero.

.VARI QUALITY
Minimum acceptable correlation quality. Zero to 1.0 .
Defaults to 0.5
