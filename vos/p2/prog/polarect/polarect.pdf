PURPOSE
     POLARECT is a VICAR applications program which performs 
     a  rectangular-to-polar  coordinate transformation  (or 
     inverse)  on  the input image with respect to  a  given 
     origin.   The  purpose of this program is to  geometri-
     cally transform an image to polar coordinates,  where R 
     and    are  the orthogonal axes rather than  x  and  y, 
     thereby allowing radial and circular characteristics in 
     the  image  to  be subjected to  existing  enhancement, 
     analysis  and transformation routines in a polar  coor-
     dinate sense.   After polar processing,  the  resultant 
     image may then be transformed back to rectangular coor-
     dinates. The program will operate on BYTE and HALF images,
     type is determined from the VICAR label.

OPERATION
  
     POLARECT  transforms the input image from the  standard 
     rectangular  coordinate  system to a  polar  coordinate 
     system  based on the orthogonal axes R and THETA. These 
     orthogonal axes are represented in the polar image by R 
     in the sample direction, and THETA in the direction  of 
     increasing  line  count as shown  in  Figure  1.   This 
     convention  was  used  in order to permit  the  use  an 
     angular  resolution as small as desired,  even though a 
     large  angular coverage may be desired,  the number  of 
     lines in the polar image becomes large. In general, the 
     radial  coverage  represented by the  sample  direction 
     remains relatively small,  thereby adhering to physical 
     record length constraints.

     The variables defined by the parameters RMIN (R1), RMAX 
     (R2), and RANGE (A1 and A2) are also shown in Figure 1.

     The  rectangular image coordinate system was  based  on 
     the  standard  convention of the +X and  +Y  directions 
     corresponding  to  increasing sample  and  line  counts 
     respectively. For this reason, the (Th=0)  direction is 
     defined  as the +X direction,  which is directed toward 
     the  right  side  of  the  rectangular   image.   These 
     conventions are shown in Figure 2. Also shown in Figure 
     2  are  pictorial  rtepresentations for  the  parameter 
     variables.

     Once  the  parameters have  been  determined,  POLARECT 
     performs  the  geometric  transformation  in  a  manner 
     similar to GEOMA,  i.e.,  every output pixel is  mapped 
     back  to its location in the input picture,  and either 
     four-point   bilinear  interpolation  or  the   nearest 
     neighbor method is used to determine the pixel DN.  The 
     mapping transformations are as follows:

     FORWARD MODE: For known R and THETA in the output image,

                     X (INPUT)  =  R cos(Theta) + XCEN
                     Y (INPUT)  =  R sin(Theta) + YCEN

.PAGE
     INVERSE MODE: For known X and Y in the output image,
                                      2          2
              R(INPUT) = sqrt((X-XCEN) + (Y-YCEN) )
              
                                -1
              THETA(OUTPUT)= tan  ((Y-YCEN)/(X-XCEN))

     Dynamic  allocation is used for the mapping  operation, 
     with  as  much of the input picture being  loaded  into 
     core as the partition allows.   For this reason,  it is 
     recommended that for optimum time utilization, the user 
     use POLARECT in the largest region possible when trans-
     forming larger pictures (NL&NX>1000).
     All  parameters in the INVERSE mode are expressible  in 
     terms of the forward mode parameters with the exception 
     of  the AUTO parameter which is NOT applicable  to  the 
     INVERSE  mode.   All  GENERAL parameters apply  to  the 
     INVERSE mode and unnecessary parameters are ignored.
.PAGE
RESTRICTIONS

     There  are  no  restrictions on image  size  or  record 
     lengths,  however,  the  user is advised of  the  rapid 
     execution  time  increase as input and output  pictures 
     sizes increase.

TIMING

     POLARECT execution time (on IBM) is approximately:

     a) 16 minutes for 1350 line by 1250 sample input image,

     b) 2 minutes for a 400 line by 400 sample input image,

     c) 1 minute for a 325 line by 325 sample input image.

EXAMPLES
A.   This  example represents the simplest form of  POLARECT 
     usage.   The  user  specifies the origin of  the  polar 
     coordinate system,  and allows the program to calculate 
     scaling  factors for the polar  coordinate  image.  The 
     output  picture size is defaulted to that of the input, 
     so that 1250 lines = 360 ,  and 1250 samples = RMAX  of 
     input   picture   (881.25   in   this   case).    After 
     transforming   to   polar   coordinates,    the   VICAR 
     applications  programs  FILTERAA and PIXH are  applied, 
     and  the  resulting image is transformed  back  to  the 
     rectangular coordinate format. See Figure 3A.

          polarect A B 'INVERSE
.PAGE
     Note  that defaulting picture size may cause a loss  of 
     detail  because  there is usually insufficient  angular 
     resolution in the defaulted number of lines. This tends 
     to  cause a wiggling of straight lines at large  radius 
     when  inversely transformed.  For this  reason,  it  is 
     recommended  that the user make the number of lines  of 
     the polar coordinate image at least 3 times the maximum 
     radius RMAX.

B.   This  example  represents  the most  complex  usage  of 
     parameters necessary for POLARECT.  The user desires an 
     annular ring with center at (X,Y) = (-1000,500),  width 
     500 pixels,  and minimum radius of 1250. (Corresponding 
     to the circle passing through pixel (X,Y) = (250.,500.) 
     to  be transformed to polar coordinates with an angular 
     resolution of 0.01 degree per line (output).

                      interpolation  is  between pixels  for 
                      all radii less than R2.  The number of 
                      output lines necessary to contain  the 
                      entire sector of input is NL=(A2-A1)/B+1,
                      so   that   B   may  be  considered  a 
                      scaling  factor in the line  direction 
                      for  fitting  the output image to  the 
                      output picture size  constraints.  See 
                      parameter AUTO.

INVERSE:
     RESO=B           B (REAL) is the angular change in each 
                      line  of the polar input specified  in 
                      degrees and is defined as:

                              B=(A2-A1)/(NL  -1).
                                           IN

                      Default is to calculate B based on the 
                      history labels.
.VARIABLE RSCALE
FORWARD:
     RSCALE=S         S  (REAL) is the radial scaling factor 
                      (as   RESO  is  the  angular   scaling 
                      factor)  for compression or  expansion 
                      of  the output picture in  the  radial 
                      direction.  Default is S=1.. For S>1., 
                      the output picture is compressed,  and 
                      for  0.<S<1.,  the  output picture  is 
                      expanded. See parameter AUTO.

INVERSE:
     RSCALE=S         S  (REAL) is the radial scaling factor 
                      and is defined as:

                       S=(R2-R1)/(NS  -1) (NS  =PIXELS)
                                    IN       IN

                      Default is to calculate S based on the 
                      history labels.
.VARIABLE NOLABEL
FORWARD:
     'NOLABEL         This parameter specifies that there is 
                      to  be no history  label  update.  The 
                      default  is to perform a history label 
                      update on the output picture,  quanti-
                      tatively   describing   the    forward 
                      transformation  for future use by  the 
                      INVERSE   mode.    The  use  of  label 
                      updating is recommended because of the 
                      cumbersome  calculations  required  of 
                      the   user  for  the  "INVERSE   MODE" 
                      parameters.
INVERSE:
     'NOLABEL         This  parameter  specifies that  there 
                      are  NO  history labels on  the  input 
                      data set specifying the parameter used 
                      by  the forward mode.  If the  history 
                      labels  created  by the  forward  mode 
                      still exist on the input data set, and 
                      the  user  desires  to  transform  the 
                      polar coordinate input to  rectangular 
                      coordinate  output,  with EXACTLY  the 
                      reverse  transformation of the forward 
                      mode,  the only parameter necessary is 
                      INVERSE.   Default  is  that  POLARECT 
                      history labels are assumed to exist on 
                      the  input  data set,  and  all  input 
                      parameters   not  specified   in   the 
                      parameter  list are obtained from  the 
                      history labels.
.VARIABLE AUTO
     'AUTO            This  parameter fits the input  sector 
                      to  the output picture size  specified 
                      in  the VICAR size field by  adjusting 
                      the angular resolution parameter B and 
                      the   radial  scaling  factor   S   as 
                      follows:

                      S=(R2-R1)/(NSout-1) (NSout=PIXELS)

                      B=(A2-A1)/(NLout-1).

                      By the use of this parameter, the user 
                      is  assured that the output picture is 
                      filled with the desired  sector,  with 
                      no  loss of data due to truncation  of 
                      data at output picture boundaries.
