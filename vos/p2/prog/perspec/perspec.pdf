.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "perspec"
.HELP        
PURPOSE      
             
    "perspec" converts 3-D IBIS graphics-1 files into a true 2-D perspective
3-D IBIS graphics-1 file.

OPERATION

    Perspec allows the user to manipulate the vertices in an IBIS-1 3-D graphics
file. When a graphics file is constructed the vertices are in a specific coordinate
system. Program PLTGRAF can be used to plot the object in whatever coordinates
given in the list. Perspec then allows the IBIS-1 graphics file coordinate system
to be modified. It also allows the user to adjust the origin and distance as well
as the angular relationships.


PARAMETERS

    INP and OUT are the names of the input and output IBIS files respectively,

    ELEV and AZIMUTH are the angles. 

    ORIGIN is the location of the origin of the perspective. Not the origin
    of the axes.

    DISTANCE is the location of the observer away from the ORIGIN

    ZSCALE allows the Z-AXIS to be scaled differently from the X- and Y-AXES.

    DATAFORM is how to show the X-, Y- and Z-axes. Normally, X and Y are horizontal
and Z is vertical.   

IBIS GRAPHICS-1 FILES

    IBIS graphics-1 files are a way to store 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional
polygonal objects in a file. The file contains a list of the successive vertices
of the polygons. When the list contains a line of all zeroes then it terminates
that face of the polygon. In the view of a drawing program it would be a
"pen-up" command. 

    With the advent of the IBIS-2 format graphics-1 files are deprecated.
In the new IBIS-2 format graphics-1 can replace that format via an index
column. In the IBIS-2 context each row is associated with a single vertex,
and the row order in a column determines the sequence of plotting the
vertices. A pen-up type command would involve a change of the value in
the index column.

.LEVEL1      
.VARIABLE INP
IBIS 3-D graphics file name.
.VARIABLE OUT
 2-D IBIS graphics file.
.VARIABLE ELEV
Observer elevation angle
in degrees above horizon.
.VARIABLE AZIMUTH
Observer azimuthial angle
in degrees east of north.
.VARIABLE DISTANCE
Observer distance from origin
(in same units as graphics).
.VARIABLE ORIGIN   
The view origin (observer looks
toward origin) in same format
as 3-D graphics file.
.VARIABLE ZSCALE
Divisor to convert scale of
Z values into X,Y units.
.VARIABLE DATAFORM 
3-D data format:
XYZ for (X,Y,Z)
YXZ for (Y,X,Z)
LSZ for (line,sample,Z)
.LEVEL2      
.VARIABLE INP
IBIS 3-D graphics file name.
.VARIABLE OUT
If an output file is specified then a perspective transformation will be
performed and the result output in an 2-D IBIS graphics file.  The output
is in (X,Y) format.
.VARIABLE ELEV
The elevation angle of the observer in degrees above the horizon.
.VARIABLE AZIMUTH
The azimuthial angle of the observer in degrees east of north where 
north is the y direction.  Default is to look from the south (180 degrees).
.VARIABLE DISTANCE
The distance of the observer from origin (in same units as graphics file).  
This controls the amount of perspective. 
.VARIABLE ORIGIN   
The 3-D location of the origin toward which the observer looks.  
In same format as the 3-D graphics file (e.g. XYZ, LSZ).
.VARIABLE ZSCALE
Divisor scale factor to convert scale of Z values same scale as the 
X and Y values.
.VARIABLE DATAFORM 
The 3-D graphics-1 file contains triplets of real numbers.  
The DATAFORM parameter specifies the format of the triplet:  
XYZ for (X,Y,Z),  YXZ for (Y,X,Z),  LSZ for (line,sample,Z).
