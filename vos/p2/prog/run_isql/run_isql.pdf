Enter or delete data in Sybase catalog

 Purpose:

 The reason for this script is for use in test pdfs of programs that use
 Sybase calls.  This is to allow manipulation of the database.  The
 reason for not using a ush or dcl call directly from the test pdf itself
 is that in UNIX, all ush commands are executed before any of the rest of
 the pdf.  This often results in cleanup portions at the end of the script
 being executed prematurely, erasing all data before it is processed.

Example:
 run_isql user=&user pass=&pass server=&server sy_filename=tstcatproducts.list_oview1

 run-isql use to execute the program isql, now it runs the program dbq.

 WARNING:  For UNIX only, special characters (i.e. $, etc.) need to be 
           preceeded with a backslash(\) when passed into this
           program.

      	   For example,  an account having username 'norm' and password 'no$rm'
	   would be passed in as follows:

 	   run_isql user=norm pass=no\$rm server=MIPS1 sy_filename=NORM.sql

 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

History:
 06-09-00  HBM  Replaced isql call with dbq.

 05-20-96  TLT  Removed db parameter because isql does not have one.
		Added single quotes to string values for the call from unix.
		Added WARNING note about special characters in the help.
