VICAR program CORRELATE1D

.HELP
PURPOSE:
  To compute 1-d correlated tiepoints between two images.
  The input stereo pair must have horizontal epipolar lines.
  The left image is fixed. The right image is variable.

EXECUTION:
   correlate1d inp=left,right out=ldis,sdis parameters
where:
   left is an image where templates are selected at every pixel.
   right is an image which is searched over to refine tiepoint locations.

   ldis and sdis are disparity images. The integer index
   in these images corresponds to the left image coordinate. The value
   at the index corresponds to the right image location. ldis is the
   line disparity and sdis is the sample disparity.

   for example: (sample,line)
   if sdis(10,100) is 11.3 and ldis(10,100) is 102.1 then the left image
   coordinate at (10,100) lies at sample 11.3 and line 102.1 in the right
   image. Inspect the "delta" keyword for an alternative format. A value of
   zero for ldis or sdis means the pixel could not be correlated well.

METHOD:
  This is a simple 1-d correlator which is executed on each input pixel
location. You can include more than one line at a time. At each input pixel a
template NSW by NLW pixels is correlated within a search area of width +-
MOTION pixels. When the highest correlation is located a quadratic is fitted
to the 3 nearest points to give a sub pixel estimate. 
   One of the hazards of stereo pair correlation from rover images is the
occlusion of background by foreground rocks. To avoid the correlator including
terrain at different distances within the same window the left and right
halves of the NSW template is correlated independently. The resulting
correlation quality is the larger of the two. Thus if NSW=41 then the
actual correlation width will be 21.
   An analysis is performed to determine the vertical offset between the
two input images. 20 lines are selected and a patch N pixels wide in the 
center is correlated across the entire image width and up and down by
+- M lines ( see GEOM=M,N parameter). The best vertical offset is added to
a histogram of offsets. The offset with the most counts gives the vertical
shift between images. Parameter OFFSET overrides this step. 
   In order to minimize the search an analysis is performed to locate the 
horizontal displacement between lines as a function of line number. 
This is performed by correlating the central N pixels (see GEOM=M,N parameter)
of every line across the entire image. The result gives the horizontal offset
for each line. This is used to start correlations near the correct offset
so that the correct correlation match will lie within +- MOTION pixels.
Note that this will not work well if the cameras are severely tilted.
To erase bad results the offset table is convolved by a median filter
31 lines long. 
   The correlator relies upon a single figure of merit which is maximized. This
is the correlation value, sometimes called Pearson's r. It is the quality of a
least squares fit between the dn (intensity) vales in the template and the
search area. If x and y are the template and search dn's then r is computed
from:                 sum(x*y)-sum(x)*sum(y)/n
  r^2=--------------------------------------------------
        [sum(x*x)-(sum(x))^2/n][sum(y*y)-(sum(y))^2/n]
Notice that the correlation quality is independent of scale or offset.
   After all correlations are performed the disparity images (outputs) are
used to permit a second correlation in the reverse direction, from right to 
left. This should give results similar to the left to right operation, but 
never exactly, since the correlation is sub pixel and the template is 
always begun on an integer pixel boundary. Those points which match to within
THRESH pixels are kept. The rest are set to zero. This test will often locate
image areas where terrain is visible to one eye but not to the other.
Tiepoints in error are unlikely to match in both directions.
   Finally the user can invoke a gore removal scheme (see NOGORES keyword).
This step only interpolates over gores which are 1 line or 1 sample thick.

.LEVEL1

2) correlation width

.VARI THRESH

.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
Two input images in the order:
1. Left stereo image.
2. Right stereo image.

.VARI OUT
Two Output disparity images in the order:
1. Line disparity.
2. Sample disparity.

.VARI NLW
nlw=  The line length of the template kernel.
      The template is the area selected from the left image and correlated
      over the right image search area. 
      The template is only moved horizontally.
      Must be an odd integer. 
      Defaults to 1

.VARI NSW
nsw=  The sample width of the template kernel. 
      The template is the area selected from the left image and correlated
      over the right image search area. Note that the left and right
      halves of the template are correlated independently. The resulting
      correlation quality is the larger of the two. This means that NSW
      is only 1/2 of the actual width used.
      The template is only moved horizontally.
      Must be an odd integer. 
      Defaults to 45

.VARI MOTION
motion= The maximum permitted horizontal motion of the template in the 
        search area from it's initial location in each direction.
        Thus the search area will be of width nsw+2*smotion.
        Searching begins from the initial offset and skew.
        Defaults to 10.

.VARI QUALITY
quality= The minimum acceptable correlation quality for a point to have
         in order to be accepted. 
         0 means no correlation at all.
         1 means perfect correlation.
         Defaults to 0.7

.VARI OFFSET
offset= The integer line offset between the 2 input images. 
        A positive offset of n indicate the right search area is to be shifted 
        down n lines relative to the left template in order to align the two
        input images.
        If defaulted, this parameter is computed by the program.

.VARI GEOM
geom=M,N
      Geom controls the way the program computes the initial geometric
      relationship between the 2 input images, resulting in the automatic
      computation of the vertica OFFSET parameter and of a table of
      horizontal shifts for each image line.
      M is the maximum permitted vertical offset search used to determine the
      OFFSET parameter. The search is limited to +- M lines.
      N is the template width used to correlate the data at the center of 
      each image line.
      The defaults are geom=6,120. 
      The vertical image shift operation is performed only if the 
      OFFSET keyword is defaulted.

.VARI THRESH
thresh= The threshold which determines the permissible disagreement in 
        horizontal shift between the direct and inverse correlations.
        Tiepoints with a disagreement of over THRESH are set to zero in the 
        output images.
        Note: When thresh gets below about 0.8 then many rejections 
              occur. This implies that the precision of the algorithm is
              beginning to be tested rather than the precision of the data.
        Defaults to 1.0
