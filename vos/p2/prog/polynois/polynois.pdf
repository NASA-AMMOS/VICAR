.TITLE
 Generates a noise image of specified noise spectra
.HELP
 This program produces discrete level noise (0-255). The user
 must specify the noise intensity level and the noise probability.


 Original Programmer : T. C. RINDFLEISCH
 Current  Cognizant Programmer : F. MOSS

 Made Portable for UNIX: CRI   05-SEP-94

 Operation:

    The program must be supplied with at least one pair of 
 "NOISE" parameters. (i.e. noise=(10,1)) Each pair of integer
 parameters consists of a noise intensity level,as the first
 constant, and an associated noise probability, as the second
 constant. The initial seeds for a uniform random number
 generator can be optionally specified. If no value for the
 random number generator is provided, then the default value 
 of (0,0) is used.

    The probability for a noise intensity level is determined
 as a ratio of the input value and the total cumulative noise
 probability. For example, if three noise levels with noise
 probabilities of NOP1,NOP2,and NOP3, respectively, are required,
 then the actual noise probabilities are NOP1/ACC, NOP2/ACC,
 and NOP3/ACC, where ACC is (NOP1+NOP2+NOP3). After the interval
 between 0 and 1 is divided into subintervals proportional to the
 internal probabilities (in the order specified), the value returned
 by the random number generator, RAND, is checked. The associated noise 
 intensity level for the subinterval in which RAND falls is generated
 for the current output pixel.
   
    The noise intensity level is restricted to values equal to or
 between 0 and 255, while the noise probability must be greater
 than zero. A maximum of 256 pairs of integers can be specified
 whether or not the default value for the random number generator
 is used. The order of the pairs of integers is not important. 
 The maximum line length is 3600 bytes. Since there is no input
 the size field determines the number of lines and samples in 
 the output picture.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE OUT
 output data set
.VARIABLE NLO
 number of lines in the
 output picture
.VARIABLE NSO
 number of samples in
 the output picture
.VARIABLE SEEDS
 initial seeds for random
 number generator
.VARIABLE NOISE
 noise intensity and noise,this is a required parameter
 probability
.LEVEL2 
.VARIABLE OUT
 output data set
.VARIABLE NLO
 this keyword determines the number of lines in the output picture
.VARIABLE NSO
 this keyword determines the  number of samples in the output picture
.VARIABLE SEEDS
 seeds=(s1,s2)          this keyword supplies the initial value
 of seeds s1,s2 for the Fortran function RAN. RAN(s1,s2) 
 returns a pseudorandom number and s1 and s2 are integer 
 variables or array elements that contain the seeds for computing
 the random number. The values  of s1 and s2 are updated during
 the computation to contain the updated seed. The default value
 is (0,0).
.VARIABLE NOISE
 NOISE=(I1,P1,I2,P2,I3,P3,....): the first constant I1 is the noise
 intensity level and the second constant P1 is an associated noise
 probability and so on.... A minimum of 1 pair and a maximum of 256 
 pairs of integers can be specified. The "In" values are restricted
 to values equal to or between 0 and 255. The "Pn" must be greater
 than 0.
