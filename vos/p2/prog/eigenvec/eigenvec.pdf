	Program EIGENVEC
.HELP
PURPOSE:
	EIGENVEC will compute the principal component transformation 
matrix for up to 32 input channels.  The covariance matrix, the transformation
matrix of eigen-vectors, and the eigen-values are printed.  This program
should normally be run via the procedure EIGEN.

OPERATION:

The measure of inter-dimensional correlation in the multi-variate
system is usually defined by the covariance matrix of the multi-variate
data.  The linear transformation that diagonalizes the covariance matrix 
can also be applied to the original data and produce a multi-variate 
system with an inter-dimensional correlation of zero, i.e.; completely
uncorrelated multi-variate data.  The linear transformation that
accomplishes this is the matrix of eigen-vectors or characteristic vectors.

A common application of this transformation is to reduce the 
dimensionality of a multi-variate system.  The objective is to summarize
most of the variance, or information content, in a system with a 
lessor number of 'artificial' variates, i.e.; principal components. 
Effectively, by uncorrelating the system, we are compressing most of the
information into a system with lower dimensionality. 

Assume an n-variate system ( n channels of data ).  Let K be the 
n x n covariance matrix of this data and A be the matrix of eigen-vectors
of K.  Associated with each eigen-vector A(j) there is an eigen-value or 
characteristic root, e(j).

	Let A(j) = (a(1j),a(2j),...,a(nj)) be the eigen-vector corresponding 
	to the jth largest eigen-value.

	Let X = (x(1),x(2),...,x(n)) be the n-variate observation 
	( n-dimensional pixel ).

	Then the jth principle component is: v(j) = A(j)  X = a(ij)x(i)

NOTE:  The jth eigen-value is actually the variance in the jth 
principle componemt dimension.  Therefore, the eigen-values are useful 
as a measure the information content that can be expected in the output 
pictures.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
input data sets
.VARIABLE OUT
output data sets
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size
 field (sl,ss,nl,ns)
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples
.VARIABLE LINC
Compute transform
from every nth line.
.VARIABLE INC
Compute transform from every
nth line and nth sample
.VARIABLE CORR
Compute eigenvectors from
the correlation matrix
.VARIABLE DSTRETCH
Output decorrelation stretch 
matrix, rather than eigenvector
matrix
.VARIABLE DSCALE
(Used only with DSTRETCH)
Adjust the variance equalization
scaling factors by the specified
values.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
Pixels with this DN in all
bands will be excluded from
all computations.
.VARIABLE MSS
The number of input bands,
when the input is in MSS format.
.VARIABLE USE
When input is MSS and not all
bands are to be used, use these
bands.
.VARIABLE MSSO
The number of output components,
if the output is to be in MSS
format.
.VARIABLE OUTPUT
The components to be output.
Default is to output the first
components, in order.
.VARIABLE SAVE
The name for the parameter 
dataset to hold the eigenvector
matrix.
.VARIABLE TSAVE
The name for the parameter
dataset to hold the transpose
of the eigenvector matrix.
.VARIABLE AREA
The subareas to be used to
compute statistics. Up to 50
regions (SL,SS,NL,NS) may be
entered. Default is to use
the entire image.
.VARIABLE NVAR
FOR NON-IMAGE DATA ONLY
The number of dimensions
to the data.
.VARIABLE DATA
FOR NON-IMAGE DATA ONLY
Up to 500 data values for
computing statistics.
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
Input datasets containing registered images, or a single input dataset 
in MSS format.
.VARIABLE OUT
Output datasets containing transformed images, or a single output
dataset in MSS format.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The standard Vicar size field ( starting_line, starting_sample, 
number_of_lines, number_of_samples).
.VARIABLE LINC
Statistics are gathered using only every n'th line of the image. If
the auto-scaling option of XFORM is invoked, every n'th line is used to
determine the scaling parameters.
.VARIABLE INC
Statistics are gathered using only every n'th line and n'th sample of the
image. If different line and sample increments are desired, use INC to
specify the sample increment and use LINC to override the INC line increment
value.
.VARIABLE CORR
The correlation matrix is used for computing eigenvectors instead of the
covariance matrix.
.VARIABLE DSTRETCH
When the DSTRETCH keyword is used, the output matrix will be a composite
matrix that describes the color decorrelation stretch transformation. This
matrix is the product of the eigenvector matrix, a variance equalization
vector (which has the effect of contrast stretching), and the transpose of
the original matrix (for the "back rotation" step).
.VARIABLE DSCALE
This parameter has effect only when used with the DSTRETCH parameter. The
DSTRETCH operation consists of a rotation into principal component space,
rescaling to cause variance equalization among components, and the reverse
rotation out of principal component space. DSCALE applies an additional
scaling at the variance equalization stage. This can be used to suppress
components known to be noisy, at the expense of re-introducing some 
correlation among bands.
.VARIABLE EXCLUDE
A pixel is excluded from use in determining the transformation if the 
DN is equal to 'EXCLUDE' in each channel. If the auto-scaling option of 
XFORM is used, these pixels will also be excluded from the computation of
scaling parameters.
.VARIABLE MSS
Denotes the input data is in MSS format and contains 'MSS' number of 
channels of data.
.VARIABLE USE
If the input is in MSS format, use only the listed channels. The default
is that all channels are used.
.VARIABLE MSSO
Denotes that that output is to be in MSS format, and will contain 'MSSO'
components (bands) of data.
.VARIABLE OUTPUT
The output will consist of the specified components. The default is to
output the first n components, where n is the number of output datasets,
or for MSS format output, the value of MSSO.
.VARIABLE SAVE
The eigenvector transformation matrix will be saved as a VICAR2 parameter
dataset with the name denoted by the SAVE parameter.
.VARIABLE TSAVE
The transpose of the eigenvector transformation matrix will be saved as a
VICAR2 parameter dataset with the name denoted by the TSAVE parameter. This
matrix produces the rotation necessary to return to the original coordinate
system.
.VARIABLE AREA
Sets of (Starting_line, Starting_sample, Number_of_lines, Number_of_samples)
are given to define subareas used to generate the image statistics. If
auto-scaling is used in XFORM, only the first subarea listed will be used
to gather the auto-scaling statistics. The default is that the entire image 
is sampled.
.VARIABLE NVAR
Integer specifying the dimensionality of the data.  This parameter is 
only used when multi-variate data is input through the parameter field
(DATA).
.VARIABLE DATA
1 to 500 data values may be input through the parameter field. That is, the
number of case times NVAR must be no greater than 500. No input data sets 
are used in this mode.  The covariance matrix and the eigenvectors for this 
set of data are computed and printed.
