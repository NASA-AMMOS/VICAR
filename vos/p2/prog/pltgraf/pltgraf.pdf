PURPOSE
    "PLTGRAF" plots an IBIS graphics file inside a labeled  box.  



OPERATION

    PLRTGRAF plots whatever information is given in an IBIS-1 graphics file.
    If a 3-D object is described in the graphics file, its viewpoint is
    in whatever perspective that the vertices are given. Thus, if the
    true 3-D is hidden by looking at an elev of 0 and Azimuth of 180, then
    the depth perception is lost.

    If a different perspective is desired then that graphics-1 file perspective
    can be changed by the program PERSPEC and the results from that transformation
    can be plotted by PLTGRAF.

    The window size and plot size can be selected or  automatic window sizing
    invoked.  Graphics outside of  the window are clipped.  Three
    dimensional graphics-1  files can also be plotted.  The format of the
    data in the file can be specified (XY or YX), and the direction of the
    axes on the plot can be chosen.   

    "PLTGRAF" can also plot attribute information such as text and numbers 
    from an (optional) IBIS interface file.

IBIS GRAPHICS-1 FILES

    IBIS graphics-1 files are a way to store 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional
polygonal objects in a file. The file contains a list of the successive vertices
of the polygons. When the list contains a line of all zeroes then it terminates
that face of the polygon. In the view of a drawing program it would be a
"pen-up" command. 

    With the advent of the IBIS-2 format graphics-1 files are deprecated.
In the new IBIS-2 format graphics-1 can replace that format via an index
column. In the IBIS-2 context each row is associated with a single vertex,
and the row order in a column determines the sequence of plotting the
vertices. A pen-up type command would involve a change of the value in
the index column. 


.PAGE
PLOT OUTPUTS

    The other type of output come from the PLOT and PLOTFMT parameters.
PLOT allows the user to display data from 5 areas on the CCD on an x,y
plot using the gnuplot package after exiting the program. PLOT produces
a file of gnuplot commands contained in a file having a .gpi file extension.
Another file with an .asc extension is create containing columns of data
that are displayed by the gpi file.

   The PLOTFMT parameter allows the user to generate a postscript file of
the output for use in documentation by choosing PLOTFMT=EPS. The default
is to generate a gnuplot interactive display.

.PAGE

  PLOT NAMING CONVENTIONS

  The user should enter only the parent file name without an extension
  for the PLOTOUT parameter.  The program will supply the extensions.

  For example, if the user has an input file of indata.dat and  PLOTOUT=outplot
  then for the interactive plot the following files are produced:

     outplot.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  The first file is the gnuplot instruction file and the second is the
  data file used by gnuplot.

  If the user wanted an encapsulate postscript file with PLOTFMT=eps
  then the following files are produced:

     outplot.eps.gpi
     indata.dat.asc

  Remember entering the following command gives the eps file, outplot.eps

  ush gnuplot outplot.eps.gpi

  If you move the gpi file to another directory, you must also move the
  input data file, indata.dat.asc to the same directory.

  Note that the gpi file produced by this program has the name of the
  input file embedded in the plot command inside the gpi file, e.g..

  plot  'indata.dat.asc' u  1: 9 t .......

.PAGE
USING GNUPLOT


  INTERACTIVE:

    This program uses the gnuplot package for its plots. Gnuplot is a
  separate package from Vicar and is not actually invoked inside this
  program.  Instead this program creates a template of gnuplot commands
  which are written out as a separate file. The plot is then viewed after
  exiting this program. The file has the extension .gpi. You view
  the plot by issuing the following command in the vicar shell.

  ush gnuplot output.gpi

  or external to vicar as

  gnuplot output.gpi

    After viewing the data, you close the plot by clicking the mouse anywhere
  except on the top bar of the plot. Clicking on the top bar allows you
  to move the plot to any convenient place on the terminal screen.  (While
  the plot is displayed you cannot enter any commands to the vicar shell).

  The data to be plotted by gnuplot is read from a separate file, created
  by this program, which contains columns of data in ascii text.
  File naming conventions are discussed in the OUTPUT section, but in this
  case that file extension will be .asc.

  It is possible to keep the plot alive for comparison purposes by issuing
  the following command.
  ush gnuplot --persist output.gpi
  (You will be able to enter commamds to the vicar shell after clicking on
  the mouse on the plot).

  Note: This program creates multiple output plots per run. You bring up each plot
  panel sequentially. You close each plot by clicking the mouse on any
  portion of the plot.


  HARDCOPY:

  This program also allows you to create a hardcopy encapsulated postscript
  plot suitable for publications. This file can be viewed with ghostscript
  or gimp. The encapsulated postscript file is not created by this program
  by by the gnuplot program from a gpi file made especially for this purpose.
  this file has the extension, eps.gpi. You create the hardcopy plot via
  the following command

  ush gnuplot output.eps.gpi

  This creates the eps file output.eps. You can view this file by

  ush gimp output.eps

.PAGE
    DEVELOPER Note:

    This program used to link to the XRT plot library -lxrt. Calls to
  that library were mitigated through a Calcomp conversion library,
  xrtps located in the p2 subroutine library. With the conversion to
  gnuplot, neither of these packages are used.

EXAMPLES

    pltgraf INP=FILE.GRA  TITLE="Map of an Unknown Land"  +
        XLEN=10  YLEN=5.0  +
	XRANGE=(-120,-115)  YRANGE=(34,36)  +
	XLABEL="LONGITUDE" YLABEL="LATITUDE"  DIRECT="TR" 

In this example the data window is (-120,-115) in longitude and (34,36) in
latitude, and the size of the plot is 10 by 5 inches. The direction of the axes
is set to top-right since this is a latitude-longitude plot. 


    pltgraf  FILE.GRA  XLEN=7 YLEN=3.5 'NOAXIS TITLE="Another Map" +
	XLABEL="south" 'DATE

In this example, the data window is found from the extent of the data so that
the whole file is displayed. Because of the 'NOAXIS keyword, a box is drawn
around the data but the axes are not labeled with numbers and no tick marks
are drawn. A title and the x-axis annotation are displayed; today's date is
drawn in the lower right corner of the plot.


    pltgraf  THREE.GRA  DIM=3  XRANGE=(1000,1400) YRANGE=(600,900) +
	ZRANGE=(0,10000)

This example demonstrates how to plot 3-D graphics files. The first two
dimensions are treated identically as with 2-D graphics files.


    ibis-gen LINES NC=3 NR=8 'IBIS-1 'ROW DATACOL=(1,2,3) DATA=( +
	 1,  1,  1,	 2,  2,  2,	 3,  3,  3,	 4,  4,  4,
	 5,  5,  5,	 6,  6,  6,	 7,  7,  7,	 8,  8,  8)
    pltgraf LINES DIM=3 'NOAXIS XLEN=8 YLEN=8 'DATE COMMENT=" test" +
	ZRANGE=(1,7)

In this plot, a box will be drawn around the data and the comment
"WED SEP 17, 1987 test" (current date) will be drawn in the lower right
corner of the plot just outside of the box. The last line segment,
(7,7) to (8,8), will not be drawn, however, because the second point's z
value--8--is outside of ZRANGE.


.PAGE
Optional Interface File Examples:

    pltgraf (PLOT.GRA,TEXT.INT) XCOL=1 YCOL=3 DATACOLS=(5,6,7,8) +
	FORMAT=("REAL","REAL","HALF","ASCI",'ASCI','ASCI') +
        HEIGHCOL=10 ANGLECOL=11 'NOBOX +
	COMMENT="Test annotation"

This example shows the use of an interface file to plot annotation. First, the
data in the first file will get plotted; no box, tick marks, axes number 
labels, axes annotation, or title will be plotted ('NOBOX + omission of
XLABEL, YLABEL, & TITLE). A comment will be drawn in the lower right corner
of the plot.

Next, the annotation from the interface file will be plotted.  The position of
the text to be plotted is in columns specified by XCOL and YCOL (these
positions are scaled to fit the plot in the same way that data points are
scaled). The DATACOLS specifies the interface columns that hold the text and
numbers to be plotted.  The data in the columns is specified with the 
FORMAT parameter. For this example, the first two columns (1,3) are real 
numbers and contain the x and y location at which the following datacols will
be plotted.  Column 5 contains a half word value to plotted at x,y and columns
6,7,8 contain associated text to be plotted at the same location.

RESTRICTIONS
 
 1. Plotted text must not be longer than 60 characters.
 2. Interface file text may not be longer than 20 characters.
