VICAR2 program GSPICE

.HELP
PURPOSE:

GSPICE lists the SPICE data for a specified image.  The program is
currently restricted to Voyager ISS, Galileo SSI, and Cassini ISS.

EXECUTION:

    GSPICE  INP=inputimage  TARGET=IO
 or
    GSPICE  SPACECRAFT=VGR-1  CAMERA=7 	TARGET=IO +
	SCET=(year,day,hour,minute,second,msec)
 or
    GSPICE  SPACECRAFT=GLL  CAMERA=1  TARGET=IO +
	SCET=(year,day,hour,minute,second,msec)
 or
    GSPICE  SPACECRAFT=CASSI  CAMERA=1  TARGET=IO +
	SCET=(year,day,hour,minute,second,msec)
where
    INP is the filename of the image for which SPICE data is to be listed.
    SPACECRAFT is CASSI, GLL, VGR-1, or VGR-2.
    SCET is the shutter-centered SpaceCraft Event Time

If INP is specified and the project is GLL or CASSI, the TARGET parameter
need only be specified if the target name is incorrect in the VICAR label.

If INP is not specified,  SPACECRAFT, CAMERA, TARGET, and SCET must be
specified.

.page
OPERATION:

If INP is specified, the spacecraft ID, camera ID, target name, and
spacecraft event time are retrieved from the VICAR label.  Since the target
name is not present in the Voyager image label, the TARGET parameter is
required for Voyager images.

If INP is not specified, this information must be supplied via the SPACECRAAFT,
CAMERA, TARGET, and SCET parameters.

Planetocentric latitudes and west longitudes are used.  Unless explicitly
stated otherwise, all distances are in kilometers.

The lighting angles, image resolution, target distance and azimuths are computed
at some convenient point in the image.  For high-resolution images (where the 
target covers the entire field-of-view), the center of the image is chosen.  For
low-resolution images, the target-center is used if it is visible in the image
or if the size of the target is less than the width of the image.  If not, the
computations are performed at the point along the picture margin where the
resolution is highest.

PARAMETERS FOR RETRIEVING CAMERA POINTING FROM SPICE:

The following parameters permit the user to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing from the SPICE kernels:

SPICEMODE specifies whether SPICE data is retrieved from LOCAL kernels or
or via the REMOTE SPICE server.  If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value
of the environmental variable DEFAULTSPICE.

CKNAME and CKID are alternative ways to specify the C kernel to be used.  For
example, CKNAME=FARE or CKID=M904 specifies that MIPS_FARENC.CK is to be used.
When specified, the CKID parameter overrides the CKNAME parameter.  If the
camera pointing data is not found in the requested C kernel, the other C kernels
are searched.

Within a given C kernel, there may be a number of different versions of camera
pointing for a given image.  The segment identifier for each version contains
provenance information identifying the creator of the pointing data.  One or
more of the following parameters may be used to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing based upon this provenance information:

CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
PROGRAM identifies the program which created the camera pointing.
SPKID identifies the SP-kernel used to create the camera pointing.
USERID identifies the user who created the camera pointing.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

Complete lists of CK and SPK IDs are located in the xxx_KDB files listed in
the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable) 
SPICE_CONFIG_FILE.  These files are project-specific, e.g., GLL_KDB, 
CAS_KDB, etc.  The value of SPICE_CONFIG_FILE being used is defined
by the VICAR system in use as selected by the "select X" command (X = O
for operational system, D for development, T for test, etc.).  The kernels
for systems other than O are not guaranteed to be correct.  If problems are
encountered with the kernels used by "select O", please contact the MIPS
SPICE cognizant engineer.

The above parameters are optional, and if defaulted (or if no data is found for
the requested version), the program will attempt to locate the "best" data
available for the given image.  See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode)
for further details.

Examples:  'LOCAL CKNAME=NAIF specifies that SPICE data be retrieved from
          local kernels using camera pointing from predicts or AACS telemetry.

           'REMOTE CKNAME=FARE INSTITUTE=MIPS SPKID=N015 USERID=ADC retrieves
          the camera pointing created by Amy Culver at MIPS using the SP kernel
          GLL_LONG_2.BSP from file MIPS_FARENC.CK via the SPICE server.  (whew!)

It takes longer to search for SPICE data on the basis of provenance
information.  If all provenance parameters are specified, for example, the
program first searches through all the C kernels for an exact match.  If no
match is found, the search is relaxed by removing the CDATE criteria.  If no
match is found, the REQNUM criteria is removed.  Etc.

EXAMPLES:
  gspice inp=a.img
  gspice spacecraft=gll   target=ganymede  camera=1 +
	scet=(1996,121,11,10,9,123)
  gspice spacecraft=vgr-1 target=jupiter  camera=7 +
	scet=(1996,121,11,10,9,123)

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Ex:  INP=/home/gmy/nicepicture.dat

Input image for which SPICE data is to be printed.

If INP is not specified, the SPACECRAFT, CAMERA, TARGET, and SCET parameters
must be specified.

.VARI SPACECRAFT
EX:  SPACECRAFT=GLL

Valid values are VGR-1, VGR-2, GLL and CASSI.  SPACECRAFT is only required if
INP is not specified.

.VARI TARGET
Ex: TARGET=GANYMEDE specifies that GANYMEDE is the target in the input image.

The TARGET may be a planet, satellite, or asteroid.  If defaulted, the target
name is extracted from the VICAR label or determined by other TBD means.

A complete list of valid target names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

.VARI CAMERA
Camera serial number.

Valid Voyager camera serial numbers are:
        4 = VGR-2 WA            6 = VGR-1 WA
        5 = VGR-2 NA            7 = VGR-1 NA
 
For Galileo, the camera serial number is 1 for full-frame images, and 2 for
summation mode images.

Valid Cassini camera serial numbers are:
     1=NAC  21=NAC 2x2 summation mode  41=NAC 4x4 summation mode
     2=WAC  22=WAC 2x2 summation mode  42=WAC 4x4 summation mode

.VARI SCET
Shutter centered Spacecraft Event Time of the image for which SPICE data is
to be printed.  SCET is only required if INP is not specified.

.VARI RING
Identifies the image to be a ring image.  The RING keyword is required if the
parameter INP is not supplied for a Galileo or Voyager image.  The RING keyword 
must be supplied if the INP parameter image is a Voyager image and the image is 
also a ring image.  The program uses the PA keyword value from a Galileo image 
label to determine if the image is a ring image, but there is not an equivalent 
for a Voyager image.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or
environmental variable) DEFAULTSPICE is used to determine whether LOCAL or
REMOTE is used.  Note that if SPICE data is not found in LOCAL or REMOTE mode,
the other mode is attempted.

.VARI CKNAME
CKNAME is a four character string specifying the C-kernel to be used:

  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  --------      -------------
  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  NAIF		the best NAIF kernel is used

If defaulted, the kernels are searched in the above order.

.VARI CKID
CKID is an alternative way to specify the prefered C-kernel (see CKNAME
parameter):

  CKID	  CKNAME	C KERNEL
  ----	  --------      -------------
  M906	  DAVI		MIPS_DAVI.CK
  M905	  NAV		MIPS_NAV.CK
  M904	  FARE		MIPS_FARENC.CK
  M903	  NAV2		MIPS_NAV2.CK
  M902	  NEAR		MIPS_NEAR.CK
  M901	  AMOS		MIPS_AMOS.CK
  varies  NAIF		there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

A complete list of the C-kernel IDs is located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

If specified, CKID overrides the CKNAME parameter.

.VARI USERID
USERID is a three character string which identifies the user who created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  USERID=HBM identifies Helen Mortensen as the creator of the camera
     pointing.

.VARI GROUPID
GROUPID is a three character string which identifies the group which created the
camera pointing.

Ex:  GROUPID=040 identifies group 040 as the creator of the camera pointing.

.VARI INSTITUTE
INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which created
the camera pointing.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=MIPS specifies that MIPS created the camera pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI PROGRAM
PROGRAM is the first six characters of the program creating the camera pointing.

Ex:  PROGRAM=FARENC specifies that FARENC created the camera pointing.

.VARI SPKID
SPKID specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
SP kernel used to create the camera pointing.  The SP-kernel IDs are located
in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable)
KERNELDB.

Ex:  SPKID=N015 specifies the SP kernel GLL_LONG_2.BSP

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.

Ex:  REQNUM=3456 identifies (somewhat) request number R123456

.VARI CDATE
Date and time the camera pointing was created in the form 'YEARMMDDHHMM'.

Ex:  CDATE=199602291200 specifies that the pointing was created at noon
     on February 29, 1996.
