.TITLE
VICAR program fixloc --	edit data sets containing coordinate information.
.HELP
PURPOSE:

 Fixloc is used to edit and list MARK-format data sets containing coordinate
 information. Examples of such data sets include grid location data sets as
 generated by gridlocb, gridgen, and interloc and reseau location data sets 
 as generated by resloc and reslocvo.

EXECUTION:

		fixloc INP OUT PARAMS

.page
OPERATION:

 Fixloc reads the coordinates from the input file and acts upon them as
 specified by the parameters before writing them out in the same
 MARK-format (see program MARK).  The following edit operations are
 performed:

	CHANGE - replaces the value of the specified coordinate with
		 user-specified values.
	DUMMY -  replaces the value of the specified coordinate with
                 the values (-99.,-99.) (the 'missing' value).
	DELETE - eliminates the specified coordinate and renumbers the set.
	INSERT - adds the specified coordinate and values and renumbers 
  		 the set.

 The CHANGE operations are executed first, then the DUMMY operations
 (essentially shorthand versions of CHANGE), then the DELETE operations,
 and lastly the INSERT operations.   The DELETE and INSERT parameters
 cause an immediate renumbering of the tiepoints. If the 3rd coordinate is
 deleted, for example, then all coordinates following it are renumbered to fill
 in the gap.  This is a potential source for confusion and a serious defect in
 the program, since, e.g., DELETE=(6,50)  deletes the 6th and 51st points!

 The coordinates, with corrections (if any), are listed out unless
 the 'NOPRINT keyword is used.  An array format (see NC parameter) is used 
 unless a VO or VGR reseau data set is input, in which case, the program 
 prints out the standard reseau map.

 NOTE:  Although the output file is optional, the input is never modified.
        With no output file, the changes only occur in the printout.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
 STRING-Input file name.
.VARI OUT
 STRING-Output file name.
.VARI CHANGE
 REAL-Tiepoints and values
 to be changed.
.VARI DUMMY
 INTEGER-Tiepoints
 to be set to -99.,-99.
.VARI DELETE
 REAL-Tiepoints to be 
 deleted.
.VARI INSERT
 REAL-Tiepoints and values
 to be inserted.
.VARI NC
 INTEGER-Number of coordinates
 to be printed on each row.
.VARI MODE
 KEYWORD-Specifies whether
 to print the corrected
 array of tiepoints.
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
 STRING - Input coordinate data set. 
.VARI OUT
 STRING - Optional data set containing corrected coordinates.
.VARI CHANGE
 REAL - A string of triplets consisting of a tiepoint number followed
 by the line and sample coordinates of that tiepoint.
.VARI DELETE
 INTEGER - A list of tiepoints to be set to the 'missing' value of
 (-99.,-99.).
.VARI DELETE
 REAL - A list of tiepoints to be deleted.
.VARI INSERT
 REAL - A string of triplets consisting of a tiepoint number followed
 by the line and sample coordinates of that tiepoint which are inserted 
 between the n-1 and n tiepoint.
.VARI NC
 INTEGER - Specifies the number of coordinates to be printed on each row. 
 The corrected coordinates are printed in a rectangular format unless a 
 VO or VGR reseau data set is input, in which case, the program prints out 
 the standard reseau map.
 If NC is not given, fixloc will attempt to figure out the grid dimensions.
.VARI MODE
 KEYWORD - Specifies whether to print the corrected coordinate array or
 not.  Valid values are:  'PRINT and 'NOPRINT.  Default is to PRINT.
