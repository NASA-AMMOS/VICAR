PURPOSE:
   
     "xlocus" is a new program to apply the LOCUS rotation and
     offset transformation matrix to the GALILEO Theodolite
     data allowing one to difference (DIFFPIC) the transformed
     data with the edited STARCAT version of the CCD image of
     the GALILEO Geometric grid targat. Parameters are the
     R(11) to R(22) and O(1), O(2) elements from the locus
     output listing. It is intended primarily for use with
     the GALILEO Geometric Grid images.

EXECUTION:

        xlocus INP=ETHEO OUT=TRANS T=(R11,R21,R12,R22,O1,O2)

        where
               |Y1|  |R11 R12| |X1| |O1|
               |  |= |       |*|  |+|  |
               |Y2|  |R21 R22| |X2| |O2|

 The SIZE field is ignored.

OPERATION:
   
   "xlocus" applies the rotation and offset matrix as determined by LOCUS
   to the Theodolite data set which consists of the measured grid 
   intersections for the GALILEO Grid Target. The transformed grid data
   can then be differenced (DIFPIC) with a reference set as determined
   by "starcat" or "gridloca"/"gridlocb" to locate those intersections which
   are badly distorting the "locus" matrix. In this way the poorly located
   intersections can be remove from the fitting procedure which will 
   greatly reduce the global errors.
