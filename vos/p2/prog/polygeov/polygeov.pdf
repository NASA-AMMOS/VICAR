VICAR Program polygeov, map a point set like geomv maps an image
.HELP
PURPOSE

     POLYGEOV mimics two programs: TIECONV and GEOMV
     
     It calculates a GEOMV warp like TIECONV.  The warp is
     not written out, and is only used internally.
     
     It maps a point set in an IBIS file like GEOMV.  It uses
     the internal warp to map the points.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

     polygeov INP=(tiep,points) PARAMS

     where

     tiep		 is an IBIS tabular file containing
			   the input tiepoints.
     points		 is an IBIS tabular file containing
			   the points to be moved and two
			   columns to receive the moved points.
     B                   is the output parameter dataset.
     PARAMS              is a standard VICAR parameter field.
.PAGE
OPERATION

     polygeov operates in two phases.   In phase 1, the input 
     points  are  fully  triangulated  by  a version  of the 
     Thiessen   algorithm.   This operates by  computing the
     Voronoi polygons (polygons of area  nearest each point)
     and  computing  the  triangles  formed by the bisectors
     of the  polygons.   Four extra points  are  added  five 
     diameters away from the convex hull so that the surface 
     will extend smoothly beyond the input tiepoints.

     In  phase 2,  the output grid is formed by  evaluating 
     the  triangular surface at grid point locations.   That 
     is,  a grid point will fall in some triangle,  and  the 
     GEOM  shift  will  be the linear interpolation  of  the 
     input shifts at the three corners of the triangle.  The 
     user  should  note  that  the  triangular  surface   is 
     continuous but not differentiable and it passes through 
     all  of  the input  points.   Point-surface  generation 
     routines can e compared in the following table.

EXAMPLE

     POLYGEOV can be used to prepare a polynomial surface fit
     of four types.  The keyword is POLY  and  it  has  five
     values: "LINEAR","KEYSTONE","QUAD","CUBIC", (or ""  for
     triangulation).  LINEAR fits the  best plane (in the L2
     norm or least squares) through the x-distortion and the
     y-distortion.   KEYSTONE fits a  bilinear surface, QUAD
     fits a general quadratic surface and CUBIC fits  a gen-
     eral cubic surface.  The  number of  tiepoints required
     are LINEAR - 3, KEYSTONE - 4, QUAD - 6, and CUBIC - 10.
     More tiepoints  are handled  by a least squares fit.
     
     
     Back to the  triangulation case, if the  input data set
     is a  grid, or  approximately  a  grid, a  shortcut  is
     applied that  speeds up  enormously.  The detection  of
     the grid is automatic.

TIMING

     Timing  is dominated by the triangulation method  which 
     is 0(n*log(n)) where n is the number of input points.  A case 
     with  10000  points  was run in 1.63 minutes  CPU  time, 
     and a case with 400,000 points was run in 4.52 hours on
     a SPARCstation 20.
     
     If the input data set is a grid, or approximately a grid,
     a shortcut is applied that speeds up enormously.  The
     detection of the grid is automatic.
     
     The polynomial fits (LINEAR, KEYSTONE, QUAD, CUBIC) are
     very fast.
     
     The final move of the data points in the second data set is
     very fast.
     
RESTRICTIONS

   The maximum number of input tiepoints is probably about 1 million.
   This value will increase as the machines get more virtual and
   real memory since dynamic memory allocation is used throughout
   the algorithm.
   
   The maximum number of output tiepoints is limited by IBIS table
   size (currently about 10 million?).  Internal to the program,
   dynamic memory allocation is used.

.VARIABLE PARMS
       PARMS=parm_file   Optional parameter data set created
                         by routine XVPOUT. This data set con-
                         tains keywords and data for TIEPOINT
                         and can be used instead of specifying
                         these keywords in the TAE COMMAND LINE.
.VARIABLE TIEPOINT
     TIEPOINT=(NL1,NS1,  these  specify  the input  tiepoint 
       OL1,OS1, . . .,   pairs   for   GEOM    applications.  
       NLk,NSk,OLk,OSk)  Maximum k is 100 (due to TAE).

.VARIABLE REJECT
     REJECT=r            the    floating   point   value   r 
                         specifies  a  radius  within  which 
                         separate points will be  considered 
                         as  duplicate  points  (default  is 
                         .01).

.VARIABLE MODE
     GEOMV               this  keyword  specifies  that  the 
                         output  dataset is to be  formatted 
                         for  GEOMV  use.   The output  disk
                         dataset will be an IBIS file.  Note
                         that GEOMV no longer  requires  the
                         NAH or NAV keywords.

     GEOMA               this  keyword  specifies  that  the 
                         output  dataset is to be  formatted 
                         for  GEOMA or  POLYGEOV  use.   The 
                         output  disk  dataset will  contain 
                         the   proper  GEOMA   or   POLYGEOV 
                         keywords  and  format  so  that  no 
                         addition   parameters  need  to  be 
                         specified unless desired.

     GEOMZ               this  keyword  specifies  that  the 
                         output is to be formatted for GEOMZ 
                         use.   The output disk dataset will 
                         contain  the proper GEOMZ  keywords 
                         and  format so that  no  additional 
                         parameters  need  to  be  specified 
                         unless desired.

     LGEOM               this  keyword  specifies  that  the 
                         output is to be formatted for LGEOM 
                         use.   The output disk dataset will 
                         contain  the proper LGEOM  keywords 
                         and  format so that  no  additional

                         unless   desired.    The  user   is 
                         cautioned    to    observe    LGEOM 
                         application size limitations.

     MGEOM               this  keyword  specifies  that  the 
                         output is to be formatted for MGEOM 
                         use.   The output disk dataset will 
                         contain  proper MGEOM keywords  and 
                         format   so   that  no   additional 
                         keywords   need  to  be   specified 
                         unless desired.
.VARIABLE ABEND
    ABEND=ABEND          specifies  that the routine  should 
    or 'ABEND            abend   if  duplicate  points   are 
                         found.
.VARIABLE ABENDG
    ABENDG=ABENDG        specifies  that the routine  should 
    or 'ABENDG           abend   if  the grid finding routine
                         fails to find a grid.
.VARIABLE POLY
    POLY=LINEAR     LINEAR fits a linear surface through
                    the x-distortion and the y-distortion
                    using least squares.  This requires at
                    least three input data points.  More
                    tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.

   POLY=KEYSTONE    KEYSTONE fits a bilinear surface through
                    the x-distortion and the y-distortion
                    using least squares.  This requires at
                    least four input data points.  More
                    tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.

   POLY=QUAD        POLYGEOV can be used to prepare various
                    polynomial fits.  For a general quadratic
                    fit of the form x' = ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f
                    y' = gx^2+hxy+iy^2+jx+ky+l, use the 
                    keyword QUAD, which requires six tiepoints.
                    More tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.

   POLY=CUBIC       POLYGEOV can be used to prepare various
                    polynomial fits.  For a general cubic
                    fit of the form
                    x' = ax^3+bx^2y+cxy^2+dy^3+ex^2+fxy+gy^2
                         +hx+iy+j
                    y' = kx^3+lx^2y+mxy^2+ny^3+ox^2+pxy+qy^2
                         +rx+sy+t      use the
                    keyword CUBIC, which requires ten tiepoints.
                    More tiepoints will be handled with a least
                    squares fit and the residuals can be 
                    viewed.  All input output formats are 
                    valid with these options except for PLOT.
.VARIABLE PLOT
    PLOT=PLOT            bypasses tiepoint generation phase.
    or 'PLOT             creates graphics file of triangula-
                         tion for plotting.
.VARIABLE PRINT
    'PRINT		 Keyword to print informative data.
.VARIABLE GRIDTOL
If the input is a grid (and no poly keywords are used) the
program is sped up by a huge factor.  The grid is detected
automatically and has a tolerance for points being out of
regularity on the grid.  Each point is predicted by its two
previous neighbors and the distance from the predicted to
the actual is ratioed to the neighbor grid distance.  GRIDTOL
is the maximum ratio allowed.

Failure to find a grid due to this parameter causes the 
program to apply thiessen triangulation to the point set
which can be slower by a factor of hundreds.

You can be generous with this parameter, say 10 or 20, but
keep it smaller than the nah or nav by half.  The row or 
column that is found must match the length of the other rows
or columns and (nah+1)*(nav+1) must equal the total number of
points.
