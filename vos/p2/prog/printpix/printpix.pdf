PURPOSE:
  "printpix" IS A PROGRAM TO PRINT FORMATTED PICTURES
  ON THE LINE PRINTER.  "printpix" READS THE INPUT PICTURE
  AND BUILDS THE OUTPUT BY TAKING THE AVERAGE OF THE INPUT
  SAMPLES WITHIN THE INC X INC SIZE BOX AND ASSIGNING THAT
  VALUE TO THE OUTPUT PICTURE CHARACTER.  SIMULTANEOUSLY,
  A LINEAR STRETCH AND/OR THE COMPLEMENT OPERATION IS
  PERFORMED ON EACH CHARACTER.
  IN ORDER TO CORRECT FOR THE PRINTER ASPECT RATIO,
  "printpix" DELETES EVERY 3RD AND 5TH OR JUST THE 5TH LINE
  ( FOR 6 OR 8 LINES RESPECTIVELY ) AND PRINTS A DOUBLE
  PRINTED CHARACTER ON THE LINE PRINTER CORRESPONDING TO
  THE PROPER DN VALUE FOR EACH SAMPLE IN THE LINE.
EXECUTION:
  The following is the execution statement for "printpix"
         printpix  INP  PARAMS
where INP and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their
respective parameter section in TUTOR mode.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
 THE VICAR INPUT DATA SET
.VARIABLE SIZE
 THE STANDARD VICAR SIZE FIELD
.VARIABLE NP
 INTEGER, MAXIMUM WIDTH OF
 PICTURE IN PAGES
.VARIABLE NC
 INTEGER, INCREMENT FOR
 COMPRESSING PICTURE
.VARIABLE INC
 INTEGER, SETS THE SCANNING
 INCREMENT
.VARIABLE STRETCH
 TWO INTEGERS, LINEAR STRETCH
.VARIABLE COMP
 KEYWORD - INPUT PICTURE
 COMPLEMENT
 VALID: COMP
.VARIABLE LABEL
 INTEGER, NUMBER OF LABELS
.VARIABLE HEAD
 KEWYORD - SAMPLE NUMBERS ARE
 PRINTED
 VALID: HEAD
.VARIABLE ASPECT
 KEYWORD: PRINT ASPECT RATIO SIZE
 VALID: LARGE,SMALL
.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
 STANDARD VICAR INPUT DATASET PARAMETER
 (ONE DATASET)
.VARI SIZE
 STANDARD VICAR IMAGE SIZE PARAMETER.
.VARIABLE NP
 NP CAUSES THE INPUT PICTURE TO BE AUTOMATICALLY
 COMPRESSED BY AVERAGING OVER AN INCREMENT AND
 ASSIGNING THAT VALUE TO THE OUTPUT SAMPLE.
 DEFAULT IS NP = 1.
.VARIABLE NC
 INC OVERRIDES NP CAUSING THE INPUT TO BE AUTOMATICALLY
 COMPRESSED BY AVERAGING OVER INC AND ASSIGNING
 THAT VALUE TO THE OUTPUT SAMPLE.
 DEFAULT IS NP = 1.
.VARIABLE INC
 SETS THE SCANNING INCREMENT AND OVERRIDES THE PARAMETER NP.
.VARIABLE STRETCH
 THE OUTPUT PICTURE IS LINEARLY STRETCHED BETWEEN
 THE VALUES N AND N1.
 DEFAULT IS STRETCH = ( 0,255 )
.VARIABLE COMP
 OUTPUT IS THE COMPLEMENT OF THE INPUT PICTURE.
 DEFAULT IS THE POSITIVE PICTURE.
.VARIABLE LABEL
 THE FIRST N NUMBER OF LABELS ARE PRINTED AT THE
 BOTTOM OF THE FIRST PAGE WIDTH OF OUTPUT.  IF N IS
 GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF LABELS, ALL LABELS ARE
 PRINTED.
 DEFAULT IS NO LABELS ARE PRINTED.
.VARIABLE HEAD
 ALL SAMPLE NUMBERS CORRESPONDING TO THE INPUT
 SAMPLES ARE PRINTED ABOVE AND BELOW THE PICTURE.
 DEFAULT IS NO SAMPLE HEADINGS ARE PRINTED.
.VARI ASPECT
 "LARGE" = LARGE FORMAT PRINTER PAPER, 6 LINES/INCH
 "SMALL" = SMALL FORMAT PRINTER PAPER, 8 LINES/INCH
