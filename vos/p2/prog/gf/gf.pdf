  ! GF Now just calls MF; no big deal. The only difference

VICAR/IBIS Program GF

PURPOSE

	GF   allows   the  user  to  create  FORTRAN or C   like 
	expressions to perform general mathematic operations on 
	one  or more graphics-1 file coordinates.  

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT

	GF INP=FILE.GRA PARAMS

	where

	FILE.GRA			  is a random access file.  Since it
					is used for both input and  output, 
					no output file is specified.

	PARAMS		    is   a  standard  VICAR   parameter 
					field.
.PAGE
METHOD

	GF now calls MF, and is provided merely for backward
	compatibility. These two programs are now completely
	interchangeable with the advent of the IBIS-2 subroutine
	library. For more information on the operation of the
	underlying code, see the help for MF. 


RESTRICTIONS

	Maximum number of operations in one execution is 50.
.PAGE
EXAMPLE

	GF INP=MIT FUNCTION=("X5 = X2/X3+100+SQRT(X2)")

	In this example,  X2 is divided by X3 and added to  100 
	plus the square root of X2.   The results are placed in 
	X5.  Further examples of allowable functions follow:

			 FUNCTION=("X5 = .NOT.(X3.AND.X2)")

	logical   operations  are  performed  bitwise  on   the 
	operands

			 FUNCTION=("X5 = X3.LE.X2")

	the  logical values T and F are converted to 1.  and 0. 
	for storage in column X5
			 FUNCTION=("X5 = (X3.LE.X2)*100.")

	the  logical  quantities  1.  and 0.  can  be  used  in 
	arithmetic

			FUNCTION=("X3 = POLY")

	This operation places the polygon number into the third
	coordinate (similar to the INDEX function in program MF)

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
Input IBIS graphics-1 file
.VARIABLE FUNCTION
Specifies function and coords
.VARIABLE DIM
Graphics Dimension
.VARIABLE ZEROES
SKIP or INCLUDE zero-rows?
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
				    Specifies IBIS graphics-1 file. There
				    is no output file. Results of GF are
				    written in INP.
.VARIABLE FUNCTION
	FUNCTION		  this keyword specifies the function 
					to be applied,  and the coordinates  to 
					which  it applies.   Functions  are 
					delimited  by  double  quotes.    X 
					followed  by a number indicates the 
					coordinates  used as input  or  output.  
					Up  to nineteen coordinates can be used 
					as  input.   The term INDEX can  be 
					used  in the arithmetic  expression 
					to  introduce row number  into  the 
					calculation   (see  examples).    A 
					special notation is used for coordinate 
					statistics   (see  examples).    By 
					using   ","   separator,    several 
					functions can be placed in one call
					(i.e. FUNC=("X1=POLY","X2=X1*X1").
					Maximum number of coordinates in one
					execution is 50. See the help on VICAR
					program MF for more information.
.VARIABLE DIM
Graphics-1 files have no dimension information stored in
the file. This parameter allows specification of the dimension.
For IBIS-1 interface and IBIS-2 format files this parameter is
ignored.
.VARIABLE ZEROES
Graphics files use an all-zero row to indicate "pen-up", and
usually should not be treated as data. By default, GF will
SKIP these rows. To override this feature, use the 'INCLUDE
keyword.
