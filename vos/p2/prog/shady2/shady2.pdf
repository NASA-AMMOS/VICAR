.TITLE
VICAR2 program shady2
.HELP
PURPOSE

shady2 shades a image as though it were being illuminated by a source
at a given azimuth and elevation.
.page
EXECUTION

Example:
To shade the input image as though it were illuminated by a sun in the 
northeast at an elevation of 10 degrees above the horizon, enter

VICAR> shady2 inp=input.img out=output.img azimuth=45.0 elev=10.0
.page
OPERATION

shady2 uses the four nearest neighbors around each pixel to compute a
local normal.  The cosine between this vector and the illumination
vector is computed and multiplied by SCALE to obtain the output DN.  The
subroutine STACKA is used to allocate buffers so that no size restrictions
exist.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE inp
Name of input image file
.VARIABLE out
Name of output image file
.VARIABLE size
Standard VICAR size field
.VARIABLE sl
Starting line
.VARIABLE ss
Starting sample
.VARIABLE ns
Number of samples
.VARIABLE nl
Number of lines
.VARIABLE azimuth
Azimuth of light source
.VARIABLE elev
Elevation of light source
.VARIABLE sscale
Sample scale (ft/pixel)
.VARIABLE lscale
Line scale (ft/pixel)
.VARIABLE zscale
Vertical scale (ft/dn)
.VARIABLE scale
DN scale factor
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE azimuth
AZIMUTH is the azimuth of the illumination source (the 'sun') in real 
degrees measured clockwise from 'up' in the image plane.  

examples:
azimuth=0.0 	places the source at the top of the image
azimuth=90.0 	places the source to the right of the image. 
.VARIABLE elev
ELEV is the elevation of the illumination source in real degrees measured
from the image plane. 

examples:
elev=0.0 	puts the 'sun' at sunset
elev=90.0 	puts the 'sun' directly overhead
.VARIABLE sscale
SSCALE is the scale in the sample direction.  Default is 208.0 which is
the DMA resolution in feet/pixel.
.VARIABLE lscale
LSCALE is the scale in the line direction.  Default is 208.0.
.VARIABLE zscale
ZSCALE is the scale in the Z or vertical direction.  Default is 1.0 which
is the DMA resolution in feet/dn.
.VARIABLE scale
For each input pixel, the cosine of the angle between the illumination 
direction and the local normal is calculated.  SCALE is a constant which,
when multiplied by the cosine, gives the output DN.

Default values are 254 for byte images and 16383 for halfword images.
