PURPOSE:
 To convert a set of N input multispectral images into an output set
         of either:
         A) 3 multispectral images representing r, g, b for quasi true
            color applications.
         B) 3 images representing X,Y,Z tristimulus for more accurate
            conversion to true color on a physical device.
Examples:

1. To convert 3 input images into quasi true color:
colorrgb in=color.red,color.grn,color.blu out=r.img,g.img,b.img \
color=22,304,173,222,255,322,429,255,213,190,47,187,239,255,255,369,188,174,185,
153,\
258,491,121,103,53

2. To process 3 other images the same way (using the identical transformation): 
colorrgb in=color2.red,color2.grn,color2.blu out=r.img,g.img,b.img     
    
METHOD:
  Colorrgb constructs three sets of simultaneous linear equations. Each set of
equations represents r,g,b respectively (or X,Y,Z). The user specifies a set
of known colors. These specify the target r,g,b (or X,Y,Z) values. Each color
becomes one equation. The line,sample locations provide the input dn values
for each color in each band. Thus the red equations look like:
r(color1)=k1*dn(band1,color1)+k2*dn(band2,color1)+...+kn*dn(bandn,color1)+k
r(color2)=k1*dn(band1,color2)+k2*dn(band2,color2)+...+kn*dn(bandn,color2)+k
..............
Colorrgb solves for k,k1-kn. These values are stored in the calibration file.

This is really nothing more than the integral for tristimulus. Kodak uses this
method (chemically) to color balance images using the four colors: sky, grass,
cloud, skin.

Note: Input images can be presented in any spectral order. (but see warning)

Warning: A calibration file must be used with input images in the same
         spectral order and number that they were presented when it was
         generated.

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
N input images

.VARI OUT
3 byte Output images

.VARI COLOR
Color coordinates
and dn values.

.VARI AREA
Size of image patch

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
Up to 10 multispectral registered input images.

.VARI OUT
Three byte output images in the order:
r,g,b

.VARI COLOR
(Only required to create a new color calibration file.)
 A table of color calibration values. The values come in groups of 5 in
       the order: line1,sample1,r1,g1,b1, line2,sample2,r2,g2,b2, ...
       Each group of 5 values represents a known color in the scene. There
       must be at least two more colors than input files.
       Line and sample refer to the image location of a known color whose
       output (desired) dn values will become r, g, b. You may, instead of
       r,g,b, enter the X,Y,Z tristimulus values. Then the output files
       will be in X,Y,Z units (and you should specify format=real).
       This keyword causes the calibration values to be written to a file.
       If "color" is not specified then the calibration file is read and
       these values will be used on the input files.
      
.VARI AREA
 Area specifies the dimension of a square box n by n pixels within
 which the mean dn will be computed. The boxes are located at the
 line,sample locations indicated in the "color" keyword.
 Default is 6.
