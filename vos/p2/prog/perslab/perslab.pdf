.TITLE
VICAR program PERSLAB.

.HELP
PURPOSE:
Places a perspective map projection label onto an object space image.
In general this is not desired for flight projects because the image
navigation is contained in the SEDR/SPICE data base and is subject
to change. For Space Telescope and other imagery there is no spice 
so this provides an alternative. Many programs will honor this label
and not request spice information.

USAGE & EXECUTION:
perslab inp=(in1,in2,...inn) out=in1_modified parameters

for example:

FOR SPACE TELESCOPE AND OTHER NON FLIGHT PROJECTS:
The input files in2,in3... contain ascii header info which contains
navigation information from which spice can be requested to compute
complete navigation. If these ascii files are missing then the spice
cannot be called and the user must supply all the parameters himself.
For the following example perslab first puts into the label 
everything it knows.
Then Farenc creates a file called farenc.pos containing the planet center.
Then perslab reads the farenc file and adds this to the label.
Both perslab calls are identical.

TEST FOR WFPC1

perslab inp=(w.half,w.hdr,w.dat) out=x.img

NEW FEATURES SINCE LAST DELIVERY

Version (January 22, 1997):
* The program now informs the user that it's making 90-degree adjustment to the
NORTH_ANGLE when processing data of project GLL, VGR-1, VGR-2 or CASSI.  The
actual adjustment was actually made on 7/15/96, but it seems nice to let the
user  know.

.PAGE
OPERATION:
Perslab reads the input label and any additional input ascii files for
information about image navigation.

For flight projects it reads the sedr/spice files.

For WFPC it looks for specific label entries and computes the rest
using the NAIF spice subroutines.

.PAGE

only.  These SPICE parameters will only affect the GLL and VGR processing.

.PAGE
SPICE Operations
PARAMETERS FOR RETRIEVING CAMERA POINTING FROM SPICE:

The following parameters permit the user to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing from the SPICE kernels:

SPICEMODE specifies whether SPICE data is retrieved from LOCAL kernels or
or via the REMOTE SPICE server.  If defaulted, SPICEMODE is set to the value
of the environmental variable DEFAULTSPICE.

CKNAME and CKID are alternative ways to specify the C kernel to be used.  For
example, CKNAME=FARE or CKID=M904 specifies that MIPS_FARENC.CK is to be used.
When specified, the CKID parameter overrides the CKNAME parameter.  If the
camera pointing data is not found in the requested C kernel, the other C kernels
are searched.

Within a given C kernel, there may be a number of different versions of camera
pointing for a given image.  The segment identifier for each version contains
provenance information identifying the creator of the pointing data.  One or
more of the following parameters may be used to retrieve a specific instance of
camera pointing based upon this provenance information:

CDATE specifies the date and time the camera pointing was created.
REQNUM identifies the request number associated with the camera pointing.
PURPOSE identifies the purpose for creating the camera pointing.
PROGRAM identifies the program which created the camera pointing.
SPKID identifies the SP-kernel used to create the camera pointing.
USERID identifies the user who created the camera pointing.
GROUPID identifies the group which created the camera pointing.                 
INSTITUTE identifies the facility which created the camera pointing.

A complete list of CK and SPK IDs are located in the ASCII file assigned the
logical name (or environmental variable) KERNELDB.

The above parameters are optional, and if defaulted (or if no data is found for
the requested version), the program will attempt to locate the "best" data
available for the given image.  See the level 2 help (via the TAE tutor mode)
for further details.

Examples:  'LOCAL CKNAME=NAIF specifies that SPICE data be retrieved from
          local kernels using camera pointing from predicts or AACS telemetry.

           'REMOTE CKNAME=FARE INSTITUTE=MIPS SPKID=N015 USERID=ADC retrieves
          the camera pointing created by Amy Culver at MIPS using the SP kernel
          GLL_LONG_2.BSP from file MIPS_FARENC.CK via the SPICE server.  (whew!)

It takes longer to search for SPICE data on the basis of provenance
information.  If all provenance parameters are specified, for example, the
program first searches through all the C kernels for an exact match.  If no
match is found, the search is relaxed by removing the CDATE criteria.  If no
match is found, the REQNUM criteria is removed.  Etc.

to the output with a perspective projection label.

For WFPC project (space telescope images only) there may be additional
input files. These are ascii files with information which can be
searched for by PERSLAB. These are the equivalent of the .SHH and .IMH

.VARI DATETIME
Date & time of the image in the form: year day_of_year hour minute second.
All 5 values are integers.
The only use for this field is to pass through getlabcon these 5 integers
so that a program like map3 can compute time intervals for zonal flow
correction. Consequently use the compatible format to what map3 will receive
in it's parameter REFTIME. ie: 1992 versus 92 for example.

Normally this is obtained from the input label(s).
Five integers. (year,dayofyear,hour,minute,second)
Note that the julian date is used to compute values from the spice
navigation files. Unless the project is WFPC1 or WFPC2 the spice
computation will be ignored .

.VARI JULTIME

A complete list of valid target names is located in the ASCII file assigned
the logical name (or environmental variable) BODY_IDS.

.VARI SPICEMODE
SPICEMODE=LOCAL specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved from local
SPICE kernels.  SPICEMODE=REMOTE specifies that SPICE data is to be retrieved
via the SPICE server.  If SPICEMODE is defaulted, the logical name (or

  varies  NAIF          there are a large number of these files

Ex:  CKID=M901 specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
     C-kernel MIPS_AMOS.CK.

INSTITUTE is a four character string identifying the facility which created
the camera pointing.

Ex:  INSTITUTE=MIPS specifies that MIPS created the camera pointing.

.VARI PURPOSE
PURPOSE is a four character string identifying the purpose of the observation
or the purpose of processing.  For example,
  PURPOSE=MOSA identifies the image as part of a mosaic sequence
  PURPOSE=COLO identifies the image as part of a color sequence

.VARI PROGRAM
PROGRAM is the first six characters of the program creating the camera pointing.

Ex:  PROGRAM=FARENC specifies that FARENC created the camera pointing.

.VARI SPKID
SPKID specifies the four character ID which uniquely identifies the
SP kernel used to create the camera pointing.  The SP-kernel IDs are located
in the ASCII file assigned the logical name (or environmental variable)
KERNELDB.

Ex:  SPKID=N015 specifies the SP kernel GLL_LONG_2.BSP

.VARI REQNUM
REQUNUM is a four character string identifying the IPL request number for
which the camera pointing was created.

Ex:  REQNUM=3456 identifies (somewhat) request number R123456
