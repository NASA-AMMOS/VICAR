.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program MANMATCH

.HELP
PURPOSE

MANMATCH or Manual Match, is a program which produces an IBIS format file
containing tiepoint information for the purpose of producing mosaics.  The 
program displays the a paired images with overlapping parts allowing the user 
to manually match the tiepoints (or similar pixels).

A more global view of the entire mosaicking process was documented in some
procedures in r3lib called MANUAL2.COM for Voyager, and MANUAL3.COM for Galileo. 
As of Aug.2005, these are no longer on the system.  However, extracts from them
have been included in this Help file.

EXECUTION

To run without a SEDR:
   MANMATCH  inp=(sedr.int,over.int)  out=match.int 'nosedr

To run with a sedr on image space images:
   MANMATCH  inp=(sedr.int,over.int,geoma.cor)  out=match.int 
  (note that Galileo does not have a geoma correction file,
   you must instead specify project=gll).

or to continue from a partially complete tiepoint set:
   MANMATCH  inp=(sedr.int,over.int,match.int,geoma.cor) +  
             out=newmatch.int

EXAMPLE: manmatch inp=(jupsedr.int,jupover.int) out=jupmatch.int +
         dir=ud4:[jjl059.mosaic]
         Note: the images are in the directory ud4:[jjl059.mosaic]

USAGE:
MANMATCH is an interactive program which has in the SEDR.INT file
the FDS or SCET times of all of the frames to inspect along
with all the navigation for these images.. 
You must create this file using the program IBISNAV
At the moment you must remember to use the single quote ' before all
single keywords. Thus 'HELP and 'EXIT is correct and HELP is incorrect.

Manmatch can obtain the names (and thus the locations) of all the
input files in one of two ways:

1. By the user specifying the parameter FILENAME which points to
   a file created by a text editor and which contains the full
   file names of each input picture in the order of priority, one
   name per record. This is the same file used in IBISNAV.
   So, if the first 2 pictures are called scx1:[jjl059]1234567.img
   and mipldisk:[mipl.gll]venus.img the first two records of
   FILENAME would contain:

   scx1:[jjl059]1234567.img
   mipldisk:[mipl.gll]venus.img

   This is the preferred usage.

2. By building each file name by appending to the DIR keyword
   the integer contained in column 1 of the SEDR.INT file followed
   by .IMG. You must in this mode name the input pictures
   accordingly. 
   For Voyager, column 1 is the FDS times thus the frames must be
   named the same as their FDS times; ie: 7654321.img is the file
   name of the image with fds time 7654321. 
   For Galileo the FDS times are just 1,2,3,4.. so the file names are
   1.img   2.img etc.
   So, if DIR=scx1:[jjl059] and SEDR.INT has fds time 1234567 in column
   one then the built-up name would be:  scx1:[jjl059]1234567.img

   This method is relatively obsolete.

The second input file 
contains the overlap frame pairs to present to the user.
This file is created by program MOSPLOT.

First input= SEDR.INT produced by program IBISNAV
Second input= OVER.INT produced by program MOSPLOT

When project is of Galileo, the camera s/n used to distinguish the mode of the
SSI camera is obtained from the first entry of the SEDR.INT file.  Thus, it is 
expected that the image files being processes are all taken by the same camera.

The program will attempt to present the user with each frame
overlap pair, one pair at a time. The user has control from 
the keyboard and from the trackball using 3 buttons. 
The object of the game is for the user to cursor two tiepoints
connecting each frame pair for all the frame pairs presented.
You can collect from none to 1000 points but two is sufficient.
There can be up to 200 frames and 1000 points total.

There are two modes:

MODE1 is the parameter processor. When in this mode you will 
have a prompt of the form: MANMATCH> . The program is waiting
for keyword entry. A carriage return or most keywords will
put you into MODE2. To get into MODE1 you can:
1. Depress the leftmost trackball button before depressing
   any of the others.  -or-
2  Move the cursor into the box labelled: PARAMETER PROCESSOR.

MODE2 is the tiepoint acquisition mode. To get into this mode depress the 
carriage return. When in MODE2 the cursor is active. You can move a rectangular
box the size of the correlation area over the image, called the correlation 
box. At first the box will remain in the left image area. After you have placed
the cursor over a likely region in the left image you can move to the right 
image by depressing the right most track ball button. Toggling the middle or 
right button switches attention between left & right image areas.  To enter a 
tiepoint THEN depress the left button. If you depress the left button BEFORE 
the middle or right button you are returned to the parameter processor. You can
advance one frame pair or revisit one frame pair by moving the cursor to within
the boxes indicating: NEXT or LAST PAIR.

When the last pair has been reached you will return to
the parameter processor. To exit type: 'EXIT.
Interactive parameters are listed with: 'HELP.

The program performs correlations to assist in precision. The
default size is: 64 by 64.

.page
SEDR PARAMETER

If the SEDR=SEDR is specified, then the program will read in the SEDR 
information from the first file to help the user visually locate the
overlapping coordinates of the paired image when in tiepoint acquisition mode.
This assistance is done by synchronizing the movement of two tiepoint boxes
on the left and right side of the image.  

Occasionally the SEDR is bad and the synchronization would result in nothing 
but annoyance.  In such case, the user may initiate the program with 
SEDR=NOSEDR to disable the SEDR control for the whole interactive session.
Another way is to temporarily disable SEDR control with the 'NOSEDR in the
parameter processor mode.

.PAGE
FILE STRUCTURE:
  The tiepoints file is an IBIS format tabular file. It consists
of 512 byte records where each column of data is written as
sequential records until exhausted. The next column begins at the
start of the next record etc. Record #1 contains the number of points
per column. All data is real*4 binary.
