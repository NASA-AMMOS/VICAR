PURPOSE
     POLYGEN is an IBIS applications program used to  create 
     an  IBIS  graphics  file  consisting  of  line  segment 
     information.   Data  input  is free format and 
     may be specified as real or integer values.  The output 
     data  file  will  consist of several  line  and  sample 
     coordinates suitable for input to any of the IBIS POLY-
     line  programs.   The size of the output file  will  be 
     512 samples by n lines.

TAE COMMAND LINE FORMAT
     POLYGEN OUT=graph PARAMS
     where
     OUT                 is an IBIS graphics file.
     PARAMS              is a standard VICAR parameter field.

METHOD                             

     Data  points are processed as they are  entered.   When 
     the   MDATA   parameter  is  used   data   values   are 
     interpolated  and  the line string is  terminated  with 
     0.,0.  When the DATA parameter is used, the data points 
     are transferred directly to the output file.   No 0.,0. 
     point is added.  Both parameter keywords and associated 
     data  may  be  used in a single operation  of  POLYGEN, 
     however  the keywords DATA and MDATA may  be  specified 
     only  once each.   If both keywords are specified,  the 
     data following the DATA keyword is written on the  IBIS 
     graphics file first.

EXAMPLE 1

     POLYGEN OUT=graph DATA=(20,30, 32,33, 40,33, 0,0,+
                     26,35, 27,35, 0,0,+
                     16,22, 22,25, 32,25, 32,22, 16,22, 0,0)

     Data  points  are  transferred directly to  the  output 
     file,  OUT,  in the order in which they are input.   In 
     this example points are set up as line segment data for 
     the IBIS POLY-line routines.

EXAMPLE 2

     POLYGEN OUT=graph MDATA=(35,70, 46,150,  10,
                              62,10, 65,36,   18)

     Two  line strings are to be generated in this  example.  
     The  first line string beginning at line 35 and  sample 
     70 and ending at line 46 and sample 150 will consist of 
     10 points.   The second line will consist of 18 points.  
     Both line strings will be terminated with a 0.,0.  line 
     and sample point.

EXAMPLE 3

     POLYGEN OUT=graph MDATA=(16,12, 38,120, 63),+
                 DATA=(22,35, 36,75, 0,0, 25,37, 26,82, 0,0)

     In  this  example both keywords  are  specified.   Data 
     following the DATA keyword are transferred directly  to 
     the  output file first.   Then a line string consisting 
     of 62 data points interpolated between line and  sample 
     points  16,12  and  18,120 follows.   Since  the  MDATA 
     parameter  has  been  specified,   the  file  will   be 
     terminated with a 0,0 point.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE OUT
Output graphics file
.VARIABLE DATA
Specifies pairs (L,S) to output
.VARIABLE MDATA
Line segment filling option
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE DATA
     DATA=(L1,S1,L2,S2,    The DATA parameter specifies that 
           ...,Ln,Sn)      a series of pixel coordinates are 
                           to be transferred directly to the 
                           graphics  file.   Any  number  of 
                           line and sample points may follow 
                           the DATA parameters.
.VARIABLE MDATA
     MDATA=(SL,SS,EL,ES,N) MDATA   specifies  that  a   line 
                           segment  filling option is to  be 
                           invoked.   A  line having N total 
                           points  is interpolated  for  the 
                           line    segment   beginning    at 
                           starting  line,  starting  sample 
                           (SL,SS)   and  ending  at  ending 
                           line,   ending  sample   (EL,ES).  
                           SL,SS and EL,ES are the endpoints 
                           of  the  output  line,   and  N-2 
                           points  are interpolated between.  
                           The   line  segment   terminating 
                           value (0.,0.) is added at the end 
                           of the line segment, consequently 
                           n+1  pairs of values are  output.  
                           Several   line  strings  may   be 
                           processed     subsequently     by 
                           repetitions  of  the  five   data 
                           values.
