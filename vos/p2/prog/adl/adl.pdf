.HELP
ADL adds a constant value to pixels that are on lines (oriented
in any direction) that have been specified by their end points.
Several different lines may be drawn simultaneously, using differing
constants. The lines drawn by ADL are one pixel wide. If the DN value
of a pixel on a line is to be adjusted to a value less than 0, it is set
to 0; if a pixel is to be adjusted to a value greater than 255, it is
set to 255.
RESTRICTIONS;
1. Maximum image size is 10000 lines and 10000 samples.
2. Maximum number of lines to be drawn is 25.
3. Maximum number of pixels to be changed is 12000.
4. Byte data only.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE ADD
For each line that is to be added to the image, a set of 5 values
follow the keyword ADD. These 5 values are:
     1  The value added to all pixels on the line. (positive or negative)
     2  The line number of the first end point.
     3  The sample number of the first end point.
     4  The line number of the other end point.
     5  The sample number of the other end point.
Up to 25 sets of 5 values may follow the ADD keyword. End points may be
specified in any order.
