.TITLE
VICAR program SNYDER

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To make images of the centric coordinates resulting from original auxiliary
coordinates.
Part of a package of programs including TRICOEF and MAPAUX to map project
irregularly shaped objects.

EXECUTION:
snyder out=(lat,lon,dlat,dlon)

where:

lat and lon are maps in rectangular projections the same size and format as
the input images. These images contain the planetocentric lat and lon
respectively which map to the conformal or authalic lat and lon of their pixel
coordinates. ie: the contents are the centric coordinates of the auxiliary
arguments.

dlat and dlon are images of the displacement of the computed centric 
coordinates from their initial auxiliary values.

.PAGE

METHOD:

The following steps are executed for every output pixel:
The auxiliary coordinates are computed from the image location.
Triaxtran computes the centric locations.

.LEVEL1

.VARI OUT
Output images
LAT (latitude)
LON (longitude)
Delta_lat
Delta_lon

.VARI PROPERTY
conformal or
authalic

.VARI NL
lines in output

.VARI NS
samples in output

.VARI PLANET
Planet name
 
.VARI ARCHIVE
Path name for
tricoef file.

.LEVEL2

.VARI OUT
Four outputs: Lat, Lon, Dlat, Dlon
Lat is the planetocentric latitude at the auxiliary argument location.
Lon is the planetocentric longitude at the auxiliary argument location.
Dlat is the latitude shift from auxiliary to centric
Dlon is the longitude shift from auxiliary to centric

.VARI PROPERTY
Map property
CONFORMAL (default)
AUTHALIC

.VARI NL
lines in output
Defaults to the first input image size.

.VARI NS
samples in output
Defaults to the first input image size.

.VARI PLANET
The planet or object name.
 
.VARI ARCHIVE
Path and filename for the Tricoef coefficient ibis file.
