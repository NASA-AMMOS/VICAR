FITSIN  --  log FITS format data.
.HELP
PURPOSE:
       
   FITSIN is a VICAR*2 Applications program to convert FITS formatted
Astronomical data into VICAR*2 formatted image files. It is based on 
documentation by Don Wells of NRAO.

OPERATION:

	Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) tapes are a general interchange
data format used by radio and optical astronomy observatories for passing
multidimensional data.  In the original definition the tape format consisted
of fixed length records of 2880 bytes with at least one header block of ASCII
information that preceeds the binary (data) information. The fixed length
record of 2880 bytes was chosen because it was divisible by the word lengths
of the most common computer systems of the late 1970's. However, since the
packing density of 1/2-inch tape was pretty poor when newer tape drives
became available in the 1980's the standard was revised to allow up to 10
logical 2880 byte records to be packed into up to 28800 bytes in a physical
block. The FITS keyword BLOCKED = T was added to denote that perhaps the tape
was blocked at greater than 2880 bytes. Note that it does not demand that
the tape be blocked only that it might be. 

	The data records from the instrument are packed into these
fixed length records after the FITS header.

	FITSIN reads the FITS header block of 2880 bytes and extracts
information from it. The entire header block is printed out on the log. All
or portions of the FITS ASCII header can be passed to the VICAR history
label. They will be stored as comments inside the VICAR label using the
keyword "VFnnn=" where nnn are three digits starting with 001. A maximum
of 999 label entries are allowed.

	FITS tapes may or may not contain ANSI standard labels.  If you 
process an ANSI FITS tape as an unlabeled tape then the real FITS images
files numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,... will be file numbers 2, 5, 8, 11,... on the
tape. File numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc will be ANSI header records.


FITS HEADER 

	Each header block consists of 36 80-byte records (card images).
The first 10 columns of each card image contains an 8-character keyword
followed by a blank and an equals sign. Columns 11 through 30 contain a
value or string in ASCII characters which is right-justified. Columns 31
through 80 are a comment field. The first character of a comment field
(column 31) is a slash, /.

	The first FITS header record at a minimum consists of the following
information:

        '         111111111122222222223'  <--card column number
        '123456789012345678901234567890'
        'SIMPLE   =               T'            !LOGICAL
        'BITPIX   =              16'            !INTEGER
        'NAXIS    =               2'            !INTEGER
        'NAXIS1   =             512'            !INTEGER
        'NAXIS2   =             512'            !INTEGER
        'END                       '

	The first card contains "SIMPLE    =" in columns 1 through 10  
followed by a logical "T" or "F" in column 30. "T" indicates that the
tape format follows the basic rules of FITS format. "F" implies that
it does not.
	The second card contains "BITPIX    =" which gives the number of bits
per pixel in each data record.  The valid values are 8, 16, 32, -32 and -64.
All axes of data must have the same number of bits per pixel. Note that
integer data types 8, 16 and 32 are byte-reversed from the VAX and that 
BITPIX=-32 is IEEE floating point format, and -64 is IEEE double precision
floating point formate, not VAX floating and double, respectively.
	The third card contains "NAXIS     =" which gives the number of
dimensions (axes) of the data.  FITSIN currently only processes three
dimensions or less.  When a sample tape of four or more dimensions is
received then it should be possible to convert the data to IBIS tabular
files although the current program does not do this.
	The fourth and subsequent cards (up to the number of dimensions)
contain "NAXIS1    =", "NAXIS2     =", "NAXIS3    =",...,"NAXISn    ="
which define the number of pixels along each dimension, n.
	Any number of optional header cards may follow.
	The last card is always the "END" card.

	FITS allows many optional header cards.  These optional header cards
vary from one sensor to another and one observatory to another. Some of 
the more important ones, as far as FITSIN is concerned, are BZERO, BSCALE,
BUNIT, OBJECT, DATE, DATAMAX, DATAMIN, COMMENT, HISTORY, and BLANK. For
example, the following FITS keywords are never passed to the VICAR label:
	SIMPLE
	BITPIX
	NAXIS
	NAXISm	(where m is an integer)
	END
	
The following FITS keywords are always passed to the VICAR label if found:
	BZERO
	BSCALE
	BUNIT
	OBJECT
	DATE
	EXTEND
	XTENSION 
	TABNAME 
	BLANK
	DATAMAX 
	DATAMIN 
	EXTNAME 
	EXTVER 
	EXTLEVEL 
	TFIELDS 

An example of a more complete FITS header is one from the 200 inch
telescope at Palomar.

CONVERSION OF FITS HEADERS INTO VICAR LABELS

	FITS header records are converted into VICAR label items using
the VFxxx keyword. Up to 999 labels can be transferred.  For example,
FITS keyword   

CRVAL1  =  5.9551000976563E+03 / Angstroms                                      

will transfer as

VF023='CRVAL1  =  5.9551000976563E+03 / Angstroms                   '


Many of the FITS labels have strings in them. By convention a string
begins with a single quote (') and ends with another quote.  Transfer
of single quotes to VICAR labels cause problems so single quotes are
converted into double quotes  into VICAR labels.  For example,
FITS keyword

OBJECT  = 'L637              ' /                                                

This would be converted into the VICAR label item

VF003='OBJECT  = "L637              " /                                '       



FITS DATA

	Data on fits tape are packed into 2880 byte fixed length records.
The label items BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1, NAXIS2, ..., NAXISn describe how
the data is packed. BITPIX which can only take on the values 8, 16, 32,
-32 and -64 tell how many pits there are per pixel.  NAXIS tells how many
dimensions the data has. FITSIN in its current implementation can
process only values of 1, 2 and 3. NAXIS1, NAXIS2 and NAXIS3 give
the number of pixels per axis (sample, line, band) in VICAR nomenclature.
It is common to use BITPIX of 8 and NAXIS=0 for FITS tabular data.

PARAMETERS

	The OUT=filename parameter is not required.  If not given then
only the header of the INP= file is scanned and printed out to the terminal
and/or session log.  The scan will also state the number of FITS keywords
found and the number. Up to 10 output files can be given for multiple
FITS data sets per FITS file.

	The HEADER= parameter is not required. It saves each FITS label 
in a file which has 80 byte fixed length records. No FITS labels are 
created or omitted in this file and no other parameter controls the
contents. The HEADER file does not have VICAR labels.  Up to 10 HEADER
files are allowed for multiple data sets per FITS file.

	The parameter DATA="FITS"/"TRUE"/"U16" refers to the data format to
pass to the VICAR image. The default is FITS format which means that 
it will pass to the output image the same data format that is stored in the FITS
image. If the FITS data is 8 bit then the output will be VICAR format
'BYTE', if 16 bit then the output will be VICAR format 'HALF', etc.
In this mode it will thus ignore any BSCALE and BZERO FITS labels if
found in the FITS label. Consequently, if the original experimenter
normalized the data using BSCALE and BZERO to pack the data in 8 or 16 bit
format the VICAR image will retain this packing.  For some applications
this is entirely acceptable, for others it is not.

	If DATA="TRUE" then FITSIN will transform the FITS data into a VICAR
'REAL'format data set regardless of the FITS data values. It will then use the
FITS BSCALE and BZERO values stored in the FITS label to convert the data
(whatever the format, 8 bit, 16 bit or 32 bit integers or 32-bit IEEE
FITS floating point formats) into VAX 'REAL' format by the formula

			REAL = (FITS*BSCALE)+BZERO
where,

REAL is the R*4 output value in the VICAR image,
FITS is the FITS stored data value in 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit or -32 bit format,
BSCALE is the value stored in the FITS BSCALE header record,
BZERO is the value stored in the FITS BZERO header record.
					
If no BSCALE or BZERO values are found in the label when you give this option
then FITSIN will warn you and then use default values of BSCALE=1.0 and
BZERO=0.0 to do the conversion. Thus, use of the "DATA=TRUE" option will
force the output to be VICAR 'REAL' no matter what format the FITS data is in.

	DATA="U16"
	FITS data assumes that 8-bit is unsigned and 16-bit is signed. VICAR 
uses the same convention. Consequently, there can be problems for displaying 
in VICAR 16-bit FITS data converted to VICAR HALF format by FITSIN.
It will show up as -32768 to +32767 in VICAR. To get around this you can
force 16-bit data into a 32-bit integer (VICAR FULL format). Use DATA="U16" 
to give properly scaled data from 0 to 65535. The U16  parameter
will use BSCALE and BZERO if given in the FITS header.

	The BLOCK= parameter is only for reading of blocked FITS tapes. Valid entries
are "BLOCK" or "NOBLOCK".  If "BLOCK" is entered then enter a value of from one
to 10 for "FACTOR".  

Other parameters are geared toward limiting the FITS header keywords from
being passed to the VICAR label since only 999 are allowed. The options for
selecting which FITS labels to pass to the VICAR label are the following:

	PASS="FITS KEYWORD" - Indicates at which FITS keyword to begin passing
	the FITS label records to VICAR label records.  By default, FITS 
	keywords starting after FITS keyword "NAXIS3 =" are passed or
	"NAXIS =" if NAXIS = 0 (in the case of tables).
	
	EXCISE="FITS KEYWORD" - Indicates which FITS keywords not to pass to
	the VICAR label records.  Up to 10 keywords may be EXCISEd. By default
	no FITS keywords are excised.
	
	COMMENT="COMMENT"/"NOCOMMENT" - Pass/Don't Pass FITS "COMMENT =" records
	to the VICAR label.  By default, FITS "COMMENT =" keywords are passed.
	
	HISTORY="HISTORY"/"NOHISTORY" - Pass/Don't Pass FITS "HISTORY =" records
	to the VICAR label.  By default, FITS "HISTORY =" keywords are passed.
	
	NULL="NULL"/"NONULL" - Pass/Don't Pass FITS blank (null) records to
	the VICAR label.  By default, null keyword records are passed.

Note that by specifying PASS and EXCISE keywords along with COMMENT="NOCOMMENT",
HISTORY="NOHISTORY", and/or NULL="NONULL" that FITS "COMMENT=", "HISTORY=" and
null records will not be passed to the VICAR label. This technique is normally
used after a tape scan which detects pages of FITS label information which is
of little use to the VICAR user.

	TABLIST="LIST"/"NOLIST" - List FITS tables to screen


FITS files can transfer text data. This is usually done by the following:
SIMPLE  =                    T / Standard FITS format
BITPIX  =                    8 / Character Information
NAXIS   =                    0 / No image data array present
EXTEND  =                    T / Extension exists
 .
 .
 .
END
XTENSION= 'TABLE   '           / Table Extension
BITPIX  =                    8 / Character Information
NAXIS   =                    2 / Two-dimensional table
NAXIS1  =                   80 / Number of characters per line
NAXIS2  =                  560 / Number of rows
PCOUNT  =                    0 / No Random Parameters
GCOUNT  =                    1 / Only one group
TFIELDS =                    1 / One field per row

EXTNAME = 'REV_1_1 '           / Generic Comments
EXTVER  =                    1 / Integer Version Number

TTYPE1  = 'TEXT    '           / Free text
TBCOL1  =                    1 / Start in column 1
TFORM1  = 'A80     '           / 80 Character Field

END

You can list such text files to screen by using the TABLIST=LIST option

Suggestions for future:
    1 remove PASS,  EXCISE, HISTORY and COMMENT parameters. 
      They were only used on old VAX code that had limitations
      on the number of labels.
    2 Use fitsio for data interpretation. Leave ibis tables though

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 A FITS formatted data file on tape or disk.
.VARIABLE OUT
 A Vicar formatted output image filename. Output can be 'BYTE', 'HALF', 'FULL'
 or 'REAL' depending on FITS format or the FITSIN parameter "DATA="
.VARIABLE HEADER
 An output file containing FITS label information in ASCII 80 byte fixed
 length records.
.VARIABLE DATA
 STRING-OPTIONAL
 Data format to pass to VICAR image. Default is "FITS" tape format which
 can be 'BYTE', 'HALF', 'FULL'  or 'REAL'.
 
 If "TRUE" then will pass R*4 format data to VICAR using FITS parameters
 BSCALE and BZERO keywords in FITS labels based on the formula 

	"TRUE" = (FITS*BSCALE)+BZERO.
 
 If DATA is set to "TRUE" and no BSCALE or BZERO values are not found then
 the program will warn you, but will create an output data set of type
 real*4 by using the default settings of BSCALE=1.0 and BZERO=0.0.
 
 When DATA=TRUE output file will always be 'REAL'.
 Use U16 to transform unsigned FITS data into unsigned VICAR FULL data since
 VICAR uses 16-bit signed data.

 Must be integer. 
 Find Blocking factor from MIPL TAPES utility.
 DEFAULT=1
.VARIABLE PASS
 STRING-OPTIONAL
 Pass to VICAR history label the FITS label records beginning
 with PASS="FITS KEYWORD". Normally this is done after a tape scan.
 
 "BSCALE =", "BZERO =", "BUNIT =", "OBJECT =", "COMMENT =" and "DATE ="
 keywords will always be passed to the VICAR label even if found before the
 FITS keyword you choose for PASS=.
 
 DEFAULT=-- (All FITS labels)
.VARIABLE EXCISE
 STRING-OPTIONAL
 Don't pass to VICAR history label the FITS label records beginning
 with EXCISE="FITS KEYWORD". This gives you the option of eliminating other
 less helpful FITS  keywords. Normally this is done after a tape scan.
 Up to 10 keywords may be excised in addition to those specified with the
 COMMENT, HISTORY, and NULL keywords.
