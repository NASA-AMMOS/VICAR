.TITLE
VICAR Program RADDIST
.HELP

RADDIST is a VICAR applications program which produces a MARK-format
coordinate set similar to GRIDGEN output.  However, RADDIST output is a
rectilinear set which has been transformed by a radial distortion.

EXECUTION

	raddist out parms

OPERATION

A geometric radial distortion is applied to set of points in a regular
grid.  The geometry of the undistorted grid is defined by the NROW, NCOL,
and INCR parameters.  The coordinates of the output points are written
in MARK format (see VICAR program MARK).  This is just a Real*4 file
of Line, Sample pairs on one record.

The distortion is applied using the equation:

	Rnew = Rold + A*Rold**3

where Rnew is the new radius from center to point,
      Rold is the old radius from center to point,
      A is the input constant.

The center is specified by parameters CL and CS.
	

RESTRICTIONS

1.  No more than 900 coordinates.

EXAMPLE

   raddist out=R ncol=20 nrow=20 inc=20 constant=1.0E-06 cl=512 cs=512
