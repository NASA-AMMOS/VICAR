scinterp - interpolate two ephemerides/attitudes to sc2rpc vectors
.HELP
PURPOSE:
The two ephemerides/attitudes are denoted previous (peph and patt parameters) and
subsequent (seph and satt parameters).  Each of these four items is a quaternion
followed by a time stamp.  The quaternions are in order (scalar,i,j,k).  They are
interpolated to the time stamp given by the imtime parameter.

note - w_t_sv0 is always 0, hence is not returned by this program

EXECUTION:

Examples

scinterp peph=(pw,px,py,pz,pt) patt=(qw,qx,qy,qz,qt) +
         seph=(sw,sx,sy,sz,st) satt=(tw,tx,ty,tz,tt) +
         w_t1=w1 w_t2=w2 w_t3=w3 +
         w_omega1=o1 w_omega2=o2 w_omega3=o3



OPERATION:

interpolation methods:

ephemeris - linear interpolation
attitude - spherical linear interpolation between two rotation quaternions (slerp)

TIMING: 

extremely fast 

RESTRICTIONS:

The time from parameter imtime must lie on or between the two timestamps in the
two ephemerides and also on or between the two timestamps of the two attitudes.
