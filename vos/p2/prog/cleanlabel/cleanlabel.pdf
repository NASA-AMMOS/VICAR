Remove duplicate label items from an image's history label
.help
PURPOSE

   This program can be used to remove duplicated label items from the history 
label of any VICAR image.
.page
EXECUTION

The following operational options are available.

Parameters in capitalized letters and words in quotes are to be entered 
literally, while words in braces represent values to be entered by the user.  
Default options are indicated.  The terms "keyword" and "label item" are used 
interchangeably.

.page
Output file options:

   OUT = (null value)  --->default<---
	This option will cause the input file's history label to be cleaned.

   OUT = <filename>
	Create a new file (named by the user) which contains (a) the cleaned 
	history label and (b) a copy of the image in the input file.  The 
	input file label is not changed.

	CLEANLABEL assumes that the filename specification is complete.  The 
	output file will put in your default directory on magnetic disk unless 
	you specify the destination disk and directory.
.page
Keyword options:

   KEYWORDS = (null value) --->default<---
	This option will result in the cleaning of all history label items.

   KEYWORDS = <list of label items>
	Clean only the label items listed.  Up to 50 items can be specified.
	Only the label items should be entered -- do not enter values.  
	E.G. You list an image label and decide to remove the line
	
	SLAT=40.0

	To do this, specify KEYWORDS = SLAT.  The value of 40.0 is removed 
	automatically.

	CLEANLABEL will not clean the task header keywords TASK, USER, and 
	DAT_TIM.  It also will not clean any system header keywords.
.page
Cleaning options:

   MODE = "keeplast" --->default<---
	This option will cause LABELCLEAN to delete all instances it finds
	of each keyword, except the instance which is most recent, in terms
	of the history of the image.

   MODE = "keepfrst"
	In this mode, the oldest instance of each task is kept and all others
	are deleted.
.page
OPERATION

This program assumes that the input Vicar image is in band sequential (BSQ)
format.

HISTORY

	Author : Megan O'Shaughnessy  9-21-1989
	Revised :

	MOS, 10-11-1991
	Fixed FR 70991, dereferenced unit number in calls to XVSIGNAL, in 
	keeping with changes to that subroutine.
        Made portable for UNIX   RNR(CRI)   5-25-94
            For SUN "close_files" proc changed to "cclose_files" to avoid 
            improper linking. 
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.level1
.variable inp
Name of input VICAR image.

(If OUT is nulled, INP is
also the output file.)
.variable out
Name of output VICAR image.
.variable keywords
Label items to be cleaned.  
Default is to clean all items.
.variable mode
Indicates mode of deletion:

keeplast 
  Delete all label items except 
  for the most recent instance 
  of each label item.

keepfrst
  Delete all label items except
  for the oldest instance of 
  each label item.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.level2
.variable inp
Contains the filename of the VICAR image whose label you would like to clean.  
If the image is not in your default directory, INP should contain the complete 
file specification.
.variable out
Contains the filename of the VICAR image which will contain the cleaned label.
(Also see general help.)

Defaulting OUT will cause LABELCLEAN to keep the cleaned label in the input
file.

Specifying a filename for OUT has the following results:
	a) The label of the input image will remain unchanged.
	b) The output image file will contain the cleaned label and a copy of
           the input image.
	c) The file will be written to your default directory unless another
	   directory is specified.
.variable keywords
Contains the names of the label items which are to be cleaned.  Default is to
clean all label items.  (Also see general help.)
.variable mode
Keyword indicating how the label items will be cleaned.  (Also see general 
help.)

MODE = KEEPLAST (default)
This option will cause all occurences of label items to be deleted except for 
the most recent occurence of each label item.  

MODE = KEEPFRST
This option will cause all occurences of label items to be deleted except for 
the oldest occurence of each label item.  

The next pages show an example of how each mode works.
.page
---- Task: A --
SLAT = 0.0		For example, assume that the list on the left 
SLON = 30.5		represents an image label.
NL = 1024
NS = 1024		Cleaning this label will affect only SLAT, SLON, and 
---- Task: B --		FORMAT, since these are the only label items which
FORMAT = HALF		are duplicated.
IPL_NA = 140.		
SLAT = 46.		The next page shows the results of cleaning with
SLON = 80.		each mode.
---- Task: C --
FORMAT = HALF
FUNC = "IN1-IN2"
.page
RESULT OF MODE = KEEPLAST	RESULT OF MODE = KEEPFRST

---- Task: A --	 		---- Task: A --
NL = 1024			SLAT = 0.0
NS = 1024			SLON = 30.5
---- Task: B --			NL = 1024
IPL_NA = 140.			NS = 1024
SLAT = 46.			---- Task: B --
SLON = 80.			FORMAT = HALF
---- Task: C --			IPL_NA = 140.
FORMAT = HALF			---- Task: C --
