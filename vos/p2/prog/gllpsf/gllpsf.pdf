.title
VICAR2 program GLLPSF

.help
PURPOSE
GLLPSF generates a two dimensional point spread function in fft format
suitable to be converted into a two dimensional optical transfer function
by vicar program fft22. The output of fft22 can be input to vicar program
wiener as the second input file.

EXECUTION
    gllpsf out=a.img nl=1024 ns=1024

OUTPUT FILES:
The output is a real image nl by ns in fft suitable format, ie: with the
origin of the psf at the upper left.

EXAMPLE
  gllpsf out=psf nl=512 ns=512 psf=(1.,0.,0.,10.)
  fft22  inp=psf out=otf 
  fft22  inp=pix out=fftpix nl=512 ns=512
  wiener inp=(fftpix,otf) out=fixfftpix sn=45.
  fft22 inp=fixfftpix out=newpix mode=inverse format=half

.vari FILT
GLLPSF includes point spread function values specific to Galileo
filters.  If filt = GRN, the values specific to the green filter
will be created, etc.  If the user enters values in PSF parameter,
this FILT parameter is ignored.

.vari PSF
point spread function profile as pairs of values beginning at the center of
the psf and extending to the tail of the psf.  The first value of each
pair is the psf amplitude. The last (second) value of each pair is the
distance from the origin in pixels. Make sure that the last pair has a
distance large enough to encompass the image.
Example:  psf=(1.,0.,.8,1.,.3,2.,0.1,10,0.,60.)
Default is to use the built in GLL psf profile.
