# Creates the html for one directory full of PDF's.  Intended to be called
# by build scripts only, and is just a convenience wrapper around pdf2html.
# Since html needs to be generated only once, we pick sun-solr as the most
# common machine, and build the html only on that platform.  Since this script
# should be used only by the builds, the destination directory is automatically
# set to $V2TOP/html/vichelp.
#
# arg 1 = the directory to find PDF's in (e.g. $R2LIB)
# arg 2 = the name of the index file to create (e.g. index_p2.html)
