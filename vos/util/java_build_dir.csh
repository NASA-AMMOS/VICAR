#!/bin/tcsh
# Note: tcsh is used instead of csh due to restrictions on the length of an
# env var in Solaris 2.7.  $CLASSPATH needs to be more than 1024 characters.
# The above line may need to be changed to the correct path for tcsh on your
# system.  If csh is ever fixed (as it is on Linux), change this back to csh.
#
# This utility builds a single directory's worth of Java files.
#
# Usage:
# $V2UTIL/java_build_dir.csh rel_dir_path [phase]
# where rel_dir_path is the pathname to build relative to the $V2JAVA
# directory and phase is the optional build phase (see below).
#
# All build products go into the $V2HTML directory.  Jars go in $V2HTML/jars,
# javadoc in $V2HTML/javadoc, and non-packaged .class files go in $V2HTML
# in the subdirectory specified by rel_dir_path (argument 1 to the script).
#
# For package files, javadoc is not run immediately; rather a list of package
# names is built up and the driver of this is expected to run javadoc.  Non-
# package files are javadoc'd here.
#
# It is recommended that each (package) directory contain a "package.html"
# file, which will be automatically picked up by javadoc to describe the
# overall function of that package.
#
# Each directory may have a 0build.jmake file in it, which specifies options
# to build that directory.  The file must be in a format acceptable to v2param
# (basically, keyword=value lines).  Lists of more than one item must be
# enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas, with no spaces.  Valid
# commands for this file are shown below.  The default value is shown.
#
# BTW, the odd name of 0build.jmake is because 0 sorts at the top
# alphabetically, so the file is easy to find, and the file is conceptually
# at least loosely based in vimake (thus jmake).
#
# The build occurs in multiple "phases" (currently two).  In the first phase,
# code is generated from non-code sources, such as IDL or JAXB.  In the
# second phase, everything else is done (compile, jar, etc).  The "phase"
# argument says what to do:
#
# generate : Generate java code
# compile : Everything else (compile, jar, etc.)
# all : both of the above
#
# If the phase name is not given, "all" is assumed.
#
# Commands for 0build.jmake:
#
# JDK_version = 1.3
#     Specifies which version of the JDK to compile with.  Currently allowed:
#     1.3, 1.2, 1.1.  Note:  This should ONLY be specified if an old version
#     of the JDK is needed for some reason.  Most code should leave it
#     unspecified, which means to use the current default version of the JDK.
#     Note that if this is specified, the directory /usr/java${JDK_version}
#     will be *explicitly* used, rather than the normal JDK setup in vicset1
#     via V2JDK.  This could cause problems at external sites.
#
# packaged = 1
#     0 means there is no package, so javadoc is created independently
#     (in $V2HTML/javadoc/nopackage).  This should be avoided; most code
#     should be in a package.  1 means there is a package, so javadoc is
#     generated with the rest of the packages (at the end of the build process).
#
# jar_file = mipl.jar
#     Specifies the name of the jar file for the files in this directory.
#     All jar files go in $V2HTML/jars.  Note that the jar files are always
#     created with a 1.2 (or later) jar, even if JDK_version is 1.1.
#
# extra_jar_files =
#     A list of filename patterns that will be added to the jar in addition
#     to the *.class files.  Note that .class files are always added to the
#     specified jar file.  Multiple patterns should be enclosed in
#     parentheses and comma-separated, e.g.
#     extra_jar_files = (*.gif,xyz.xml,*.jpeg)
#
# non_jar_files =
#     A list of filename patterns that will be put into $V2HTML in a
#     subdirectory that matches the $1 parameter (the package tree structure).
#     Note that the same files can go here *and* in a jar, if desired.
#     This follows the same format as extra_jar_files.
#
# template_files =
#     A list of filename patterns that will be put into $V2TEMPLATES (mostly
#     for Velocity templates).  Note that the same files can go here *and*
#     in a jar, if desired.  This follows the same format as extra_jar_files.
#
# xsl_files =
#     A list of filename patterns that will be put into $V2XSL (mostly
#     for XSLT templates).  Note that the same files can go here *and*
#     in a jar, if desired.  This follows the same format as extra_jar_files.

# script_files =
#     A list of filename patterns that will be put into $V2JBIN and then
#     chmod +x'd.  This is intended for executable scripts.  This follows the
#     same format as extra_jar_files.

# no_java = 0
#     1 means there are no Java files to compile in this directory.  An
#     example might be an image subdirectory (in which case you'd want to
#     make use of extra_jar_files or non_jar_files).  If no 0build.jmake
#     file exists *and* there are no *.java files present, then the directory's
#     build is skipped (because without a jmake and with no .java files, there
#     is nothing to do).
#
# manifest_file =
#     Specifies the manifest file to include in the jar.  If none is specified
#     (the default), jar will create one for you.  Specifying more than
#     one manifest (in different subdirectories) for the same jar may produce
#     undefined results (it depends on how jar itself deals with it, although
#     it appears that jar simply merges the entries, so it may be okay).  Note
#     that there is no guarantee of the order in which subdirectories are
#     processed during the build, so there must be no order dependencies among
#     multiple manifest files, either.
#
# jni_classes =
#     Specifies a list of class names for which to run "javah -jni" to
#     generate native includes.  Includes are put in the $V2HTML/inc
#     directory.  Note that this is a list of CLASS names, not FILE names.
#     The package specified in $1 is automatically prepended to each element,
#     so you should list only the base class name with no package or
#     extension (such as .java or .class).
#
# idl_files =
#     Specifies a list of files to be run through an IDL->Java compiler.
#     (this is Interface Definition Language for CORBA, et al, not Research
#     Systems' IDL).  The default compiler is jidl from Orbacus 
#     (reached via $J2_ORBACUS/bin/$VICCPU/jidl), 
#     but additional flags may specify a different
#     compiler if necessary in the future.  All files are generated with the
#     current package name.  If an IDL file is shared with the C/C++ world,
#     it should be delivered in a .com file into the appropriate place in the
#     VICAR C/C++ directory structure.  The post-fetch fixup script,
#     ??????????????????, will extract and copy (or softlink?????) each relevant
#     idl file to the Java directories on a case-by-case basis.  This means
#     the script itself must be modified to add or remove shared IDL files;
#     the 0build.jmake file itself is not sufficient.
#
# rmi_classes =
#     Specifies a list of class names to be run through the rmic compiler
#     in order to generate Stub and Skeleton class files.  Note that this
#     is a list of CLASS names, not FILE names.  The package specified in
#     $1 is automatically prepended to each element, so you should list only
#     the base class name with no package or extension (such as .java or
#     .class).  Source is not generated because it is not needed during a
#     build; developers can run rmic manually if they wish to inspect the
#     source.  Generation of IDL files from rmic is not currently supported;
#     contact CM if you need this capability.
#
# services_files =
#     Specifies a list of files to go into the META-INF/services directory.
#     These files typically list services included in the jar, such as
#     JAI operators, IIO plugins, or MICA tools.  The filenames by convention
#     use a reverse domain naming scheme (e.g. jpl.mipl.mica.ToolPalette) but
#     the build script will accept any filename.  These files are put in the
#     META-INF/services directory rather than the directory in which they
#     reside.  The result of two different directories contributing the same
#     file to the same jar are undefined; whoever happened to get added last
#     wins (i.e., don't do that).
#
# jaxb_schema =
#     Specifies a (single) file containing an XML Schema.  This file is
#     run through JAXB to create interface and implementation files for JAXB.
#     Currently the Sun reference implementation of JAXB is used, but this
#     may change in the future.  The generated code will be in the package
#     implied by the directory currently being built (i.e. specified by the
#     argument to this script).  Note that subpackages (subdirectories) are
#     also created.  These are NOT built by default.  Each subdir must have
#     a pre-existing 0build.jmake file in it, telling how to build the
#     generated code.  So the subdirs in the CM system should be empty except
#     for the build file.  Note that JAXB sometimes generates "*.ser" or
#     "jaxb.properties" files; these MUST be listed in extra_jar_files if
#     they are to be included in the jar; this is not done automatically.
#     It is recommended that the specified schema file exist in the directory
#     being built, in which case only the filename is specified.  However,
#     it is possible for the schema file to reside in a different directory
#     (e.g. if there was some runtime reason for it to be in a different
#     path).  In that case, a directory spec relative to $V2JAVA may be
#     specified for jaxb_schema. (e.g. jaxb_schema=jpl/mipl/mdms/schema/x.xsd).
#     Note that only one schema may be built per directory.
#
# wsdl_files =
#     Specifies a list of WSDL (Web Services Description Language) files
#     to be run through the "wsimport" code generator/compiler.

# ejb_descriptor = 0
#     If set to 1 or 2, then EJB deployment descriptors will be generated for
#     all code in this directory.  If set to 1, subdirs are recursively
#     included; if set to 2, only the current dir is processed.  The files
#     "ejb-jar.xml" and "jboss.xml" will be put in a subdirectory named
#     "META-INF" below this one.  Nothing else is done with the files by
#     the build process; they just sit there.  Because it is likely that
#     deployment descriptors will need to be hand-edited, it is up to the
#     user to put these files in the appropriate jar/war/ear at deployment
#     time.
#
# dependency =
#     List the dependencies (jar files) upon which this build depends.
#     This includes both external jars and internal software that is used
#     by the code in this directory.  Do not list the jar in which this
#     code resides (given by jar_file); that is implied.  Setting a
#     dependency will cause classpath to be reset so that ONLY the jars
#     specified here (plus jar_file) will be used.  The dependency should
#     be listed without a version or ".jar"; a "*.jar" is automatically
#     appended to each entry.  This allows versions to be upgraded without
#     requiring every dependency line in every build file to change.  It is
#     acceptable to list a version number if it is absolutely required, but
#     this should in general not be done.  Note that the pattern match
#     allows multiple jars to be included in each line; for example just
#     listing "jaxb" would match all of "jaxb-api.jar", "jaxb-impl.jar",
#     and "jaxb-libs.jar".
